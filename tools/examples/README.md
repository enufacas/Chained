# 🎨 Code Examples: Beauty and Functionality

This directory contains elegant, well-crafted code examples demonstrating
the art of writing readable, maintainable code. Each file is a lesson in
code poetry - where clarity meets functionality.

## Philosophy

> "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."
> — Harold Abelson

These examples showcase:
- **Clear naming** - Variables and functions that explain themselves
- **Type hints** - Static typing for better code understanding
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive docstrings and comments
- **Structure** - Logical organization and flow
- **Testing** - Demonstrable functionality

## Python Examples

### Core Algorithms

#### `fibonacci.py` - Fibonacci Sequence Generator
Nature's mathematical poetry. Generates the famous sequence where each number
is the sum of the two preceding ones.

**Features:**
- Type-annotated functions
- Edge case handling
- Generator implementation for memory efficiency
- Golden ratio calculation

**Run:**
```bash
python3 fibonacci.py
```

#### `prime.py` - Prime Number Checker
Find the building blocks of mathematics. Includes both individual prime testing
and the Sieve of Eratosthenes for finding all primes up to a limit.

**Features:**
- Efficient square root optimization
- Sieve of Eratosthenes implementation
- Infinite prime generator
- Beautiful output formatting

**Run:**
```bash
python3 prime.py
```

#### `palindrome.py` - Palindrome Checker
Discover linguistic mirrors. Checks if words and phrases read the same
forwards and backwards.

**Features:**
- Configurable normalization (case, spaces, punctuation)
- Longest palindrome substring finder
- Word reversal utility
- Comprehensive examples

**Run:**
```bash
python3 palindrome.py
```

### Code Quality Examples

#### `code-poetry-showcase.py` - Beautiful Code Demonstration
A comprehensive showcase of elegant Python code, featuring:
- Text analysis with dataclasses
- Palindrome detection
- Fibonacci generation
- Number formatting
- Email validation

Each function is crafted to be self-documenting and aesthetically pleasing.

**Run:**
```bash
python3 code-poetry-showcase.py
```

#### `anti-patterns.py` - Learning from Mistakes
Side-by-side comparison of common anti-patterns and their elegant alternatives.

**Features:**
- ❌ Anti-patterns with explanations
- ✅ Elegant alternatives
- Security best practices
- Clear naming conventions

**Run:**
```bash
python3 anti-patterns.py
```

## JavaScript Examples

- `factorial.js` - Factorial calculator with recursion
- `reverse.js` - String reversal techniques
- `anti-patterns.js` - JavaScript anti-patterns and fixes

## Shell Script Examples

- `backup.sh` - Clean, well-documented backup script
- `direct-assign-example.sh` - Example script for direct agent assignment

## Using with Code Golf Optimizer

These examples can also be optimized for minimal character count:

```bash
# Optimize a Python file
python3 ../code-golf-optimizer.py -f fibonacci.py -l python

# Get JSON output for programmatic use
python3 ../code-golf-optimizer.py -f palindrome.py -l python --format json

# Optimize JavaScript
python3 ../code-golf-optimizer.py -f factorial.js -l javascript
```

## Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Type Hints**: Use Python's type system for clarity
2. **Docstrings**: Comprehensive documentation for all public functions
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases
4. **Naming**: Descriptive names that reveal intent
5. **Structure**: Logical organization with clear separation of concerns
6. **Testing**: Runnable examples that demonstrate functionality
7. **Comments**: Explain the "why", not the "what"
8. **Consistency**: Uniform style throughout

## Contributing

When adding new examples, please ensure they follow the code poetry principles:
- Clear and descriptive naming
- Comprehensive documentation
- Type hints where applicable
- Runnable demonstrations
- Error handling for edge cases
- Beautiful, readable structure
