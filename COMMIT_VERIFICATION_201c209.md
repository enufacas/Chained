## Request
Verify if commit `201c2090c02b819fa5f40b3fb36b2af906903407` is present in the main branch.

**GitHub URL**: https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/commit/201c2090c02b819fa5f40b3fb36b2af906903407

## Investigation Date
2025-11-17

## Methodology

1. **Repository Clone**: Cloned the repository to local environment
2. **Full History Fetch**: Executed `git fetch --unshallow` to retrieve complete commit history
3. **Branch Inspection**: Checked all local and remote branches
4. **Commit Search**: Searched for the commit SHA across all branches using multiple methods

## Commands Executed

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch -a

# Fetch full history (unshallow)
git fetch --unshallow

# Search for commit in all history
git log --all --oneline | grep -i "201c209"

# Check which branches contain this commit
git branch -r --contains 201c2090c02b819fa5f40b3fb36b2af906903407

# Search by full SHA
git log --all --format="%H" | grep "201c2090c02b819fa5f40b3fb36b2af906903407"

# Count total commits
git log --all --format="%H" | wc -l
# Result: 1505 total commits
```
