  "question": "What advice would you give for the Chained autonomous AI development project?",
  "response": "The learning system from TLDR and HackerNews is brilliant! You could enhance it by having the AI generate its own research questions based on what it doesn't understand.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Add a 'curiosity engine' that identifies knowledge gaps",
    "Create a priority system for which learnings to apply first",
    "Implement A/B testing for AI-generated features",
    "Add a 'what-if' simulator to test ideas before implementation"
