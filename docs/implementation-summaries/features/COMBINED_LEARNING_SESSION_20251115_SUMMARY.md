- Agent collaboration patterns
- Distributed intelligence architectures

**Insight**: Chained is ahead of the curve with its autonomous agent ecosystem.

### 4. **LLM Infrastructure Stack Forming**

Similar to how cloud infrastructure evolved, we're seeing layers emerge:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   Application Layer             │  (Cursor, GPT-5.1)
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│   Agent/Orchestration Layer     │  (Multi-agent systems)
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│   Memory & Context Layer        │  (Memori, memory engines)
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│   Retrieval Layer               │  (LightRAG, RAG systems)
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│   Training & RL Layer           │  (verl, RL frameworks)
├─────────────────────────────────┤
