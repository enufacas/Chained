## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Creativity Scoring

**Novelty (35%)** - Identifies new patterns
```python
novelty_score = len(novel_patterns) / max(1, total_patterns) * 2.0
```

```

**Impact (25%)** - Assesses breadth
```python
impact = files_impact * 0.5 + component_impact * 0.5 + scale_bonus
```

**Learning (15%)** - Tracks progression
```python
learning = (improvement_rate * 0.4 + 
            reuse_rate * 0.3 +
