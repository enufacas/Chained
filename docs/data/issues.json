Missing Repository Labels ⭐ MOST COMMON\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail with `could not add label: 'code-quality' not found`\n  **Solution:** \n  - Run `bash scripts/fix-workflow-labels.sh` to create labels\n  - Or trigger the \"Ensure Repository Labels Exist\" workflow manually\n  - Workflows now have fallback logic and won't fail completely\n  \n  #### 2. Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n  **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n  \n  #### 3. Missing Secrets\n  **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n  **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n  \n  #### 4. External Dependencies\n  **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n  **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n  \n  #### 5. Configuration Issues\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n  **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n  \n  ### Recommended Actions\n  1. **First:** Check if label-related (see Quick Fix above)\n  2. Review the failed workflows breakdown above\n  3. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs\n  4. Focus on workflows with multiple failures first\n  5. Verify secrets and permissions are configured correctly\n  6. Consider if recent changes introduced the failures\n  \n  ### Documentation\n  - 📖 **Troubleshooting Guide:** `.github/workflows/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`\n  - 🔧 **Quick Fix Script:** `scripts/fix-workflow-labels.sh`\n  - 🏷️ **Label Tool:** `tools/create_labels.py`\n  \n  ### Monitoring\n  This issue will be automatically updated with health checks every 12 hours.\n  Close this issue once all problems are resolved and failure rate drops below 20%.\n  \n  ---\n  *This issue was automatically created by the System Monitor workflow.*\n  *Fixes by **@troubleshoot-expert*** 🔧\n","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-19T01:05:33Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPN2gqQ","name":"bug","description":"Bug or error fix","color":"D73A4A"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKvA","name":"copilot-assigned","description":"Assigned to Copilot","color":"0366d6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKzQ","name":"automated","description":"Automated workflow action","color":"E99695"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPOOZoQ","name":"workflow-monitor","description":"Workflow monitoring alert","color":"d73a4a"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACQDadfw","name":"agent:workflows-tech-lead","description":"Custom agent: workflows-tech-lead","color":"0E8A16"}],"number":1840,"state":"OPEN","title":"⚠️ Workflow Health Alert - 2025-11-19","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/1840"}]
