The mission should follow the same constraints as all the other missions e.g. do not duplicate or repeat etc... first examine the entire autonomous learning pipeline to understand the flow. \n\nHere are the sources for Github copilot I want you to use. If you need to, create a dedicated stage or workflow to retrieve and store your learnings. It should be similar to the HN and tldr sources in that respect. \n\nSources for github:\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/copilot crawl this and read through any index perhaps pick N number of topics to deep dive collect \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com or more commonly reddit r/GithubCopilot\n\nhttps://github.com/orgs/community/discussions filtered on copilot and copilot agents.\n","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-17T01:24:55Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKvA","name":"copilot-assigned","description":"Assigned to Copilot","color":"0366d6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACP3gBKg","name":"agent:coordinate-wizard","description":"Custom agent: coordinate-wizard","color":"0E8A16"}],"number":1464,"state":"OPEN","title":"New learning source focused on github copilot","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/1464"},{"body":"<!-- COPILOT_AGENT:meta-coordinator -->\n\n> **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> \n> This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🎯 meta-coordinator** custom agent profile.\n> \n> **@meta-coordinator** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/meta-coordinator.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/meta-coordinator.md).\n> \n> **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@meta-coordinator** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n\n---\n\nhttps://github.com/enufacas/Chained/pull/1343 we made these improvements noted in the PR but I don't see evidence of those improvements in the latest run https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/actions/runs/19414806429\n","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-17T01:14:12Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKvA","name":"copilot-assigned","description":"Assigned to Copilot","color":"0366d6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACP3yyoQ","name":"agent:meta-coordinator","description":"Custom agent: meta-coordinator","color":"0E8A16"}],"number":1461,"state":"OPEN","title":"Agent evaluator improvements ","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/1461"},{"body":"## AI Agent Repetition Detected\n\nThe pattern repetition detection system has identified concerning patterns in AI agent contributions.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Repetition Flags:** 3\n- **Agents Flagged:** 1\n- **Average Uniqueness Score:** 31.77\n- **Analysis Period:** Last 30 days\n\n### Impact:\nRepetitive patterns may indicate:\n- Agents falling into habitual approaches\n- Lack of diversity in problem-solving strategies\n- Potential for missed innovative solutions\n- Risk of creating technical debt\n\n### Action Items:\n1.
