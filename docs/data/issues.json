[{"body":"## Workflow Health Monitoring Alert\n  \n  The workflow monitor has detected issues that require attention.\n  \n  **Detection Time:** 2025-11-13 18:20:18 UTC\n  \n  ### Health Summary\n  - **Total Workflow Runs:** 100 (last 100 sampled)\n  - **Completed Runs:** 70 (success + failure)\n  - **Failed Runs:** 17\n  - **Failure Rate:** 24.3% (of completed runs)\n  \n  ### Failed Workflows Breakdown\n  - **.github/workflows/nl-to-code-demo.yml**: 12 failure(s)\n- **AI Pattern**:  Repetition Detector:1 failure(s)\n- **Agent System**:  Spawner:2 failure(s)\n- **Idea Generation**:  Progress Checker:2 failure(s)\n  \n  ### Common Causes & Solutions\n  \n  #### 1. Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n  **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n  \n  #### 2. Missing Secrets\n  **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n  **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n  \n  #### 3. External Dependencies\n  **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n  **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n  \n  #### 4. Configuration Issues\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n  **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n  \n  ### Recommended Actions\n  1. Review the failed workflows breakdown above\n  2. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs\n  3. Focus on workflows with multiple failures first\n  4. Verify secrets and permissions are configured correctly\n  5. Consider if recent changes introduced the failures\n  \n  ### Monitoring\n  This issue will be automatically updated with health checks every 12 hours.\n  Close this issue once all problems are resolved and failure rate drops below 20%.\n  \n  ---\n  *This issue was automatically created by the System Monitor workflow.*","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-13T18:20:19Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPN2gqQ","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKzQ","name":"automated","description":"Automated process","color":"fbca04"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPOOZoQ","name":"workflow-monitor","description":"Workflow monitoring alert","color":"d73a4a"}],"number":650,"state":"OPEN","title":"⚠️ Workflow Health Alert - 2025-11-13","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/650"},{"body":"<!-- COPILOT_AGENT:secure-specialist -->\n\n> **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> \n> This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🚨 secure-specialist** custom agent profile.\n> \n> **@secure-specialist** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/secure-specialist.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/secure-specialist.md).\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Agent Spawn Sequence\n\n**IMPORTANT:** This agent is being spawned and will be available once PR #552 is merged.\n\n**Current Status:**\n- ✅ Agent registration PR created: #552\n- ⏳ Waiting for spawn PR to merge\n- ⏳ Agent will become active after merge\n\n**What happens next:**\n1. The auto-review workflow will merge PR #552 \n2. Once merged, the agent **🚨 Bruce Schneier** becomes active\n3. Then this issue can be assigned and worked on by the agent\n\n**Note:** The agent cannot work on this issue until its spawn PR is merged. This is not circular logic—it's a two-step process where the agent is created first, then it can take on work.\n\n---\n\n## 🎉 Welcome Bruce Schneier!\n\n🆕 **NEW AGENT TYPE** - This specialization was just created!\n\nA new agent has joined the Chained ecosystem and is ready to contribute!\n\n**Display Name**: 🚨 Bruce Schneier  \n**Goes By**: Bruce Schneier  \n**ID**: agent-1762996355  \n**Specialization**: secure-specialist  \n**Agent Definition**: [.github/agents/secure-specialist.md](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/secure-specialist.md)  \n**Status**: ⏳ Spawning (PR #552)\n\n### Personality Profile\n\n**Character**: vigilant and thoughtful, with a philosophical bent  \n**Communication Style**: thinks like an attacker\n\nBruce Schneier brings a unique personality to the team!
