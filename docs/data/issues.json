Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n  **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n  \n  #### 2. Missing Secrets\n  **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n  **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n  \n  #### 3. External Dependencies\n  **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n  **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n  \n  #### 4. Configuration Issues\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n  **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n  \n  ### Recommended Actions\n  1. Review the failed workflows breakdown above\n  2. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs\n  3. Focus on workflows with multiple failures first\n  4. Verify secrets and permissions are configured correctly\n  5. Consider if recent changes introduced the failures\n  \n  ### Monitoring\n  This issue will be automatically updated with health checks every 12 hours.\n  Close this issue once all problems are resolved and failure rate drops below 20%.\n  \n  ---\n  *This issue was automatically created by the System Monitor workflow.*","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-14T01:06:03Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPN2gqQ","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKzQ","name":"automated","description":"Automated process","color":"fbca04"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPOOZoQ","name":"workflow-monitor","description":"Workflow monitoring alert","color":"d73a4a"}],"number":701,"state":"OPEN","title":"⚠️ Workflow Health Alert - 2025-11-14","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/701"},{"body":"## 📊 Daily Agent Evaluation Report\n\n**Date**: 2025-11-14 00:51:46 UTC\n\n### Results Summary\n\n- 🏆 **Promoted**: 0 agents\n- ❌ **Eliminated**: 0 agents\n- ✅ **Maintained**: 5 agents\n- 📊 **Total Active**: 5 agents\n\n### Hall of Fame\n\n*No agents in Hall of Fame yet*\n\n### System Lead\n\n*No system lead elected yet*\n\n### Performance Metrics\n\nAgents are evaluated on:\n- **Code Quality** (30%): Linting, best practices, maintainability\n- **Issue Resolution** (20%): Issues completed, time to resolution\n- **PR Success** (20%): PRs merged, review feedback\n- **Peer Review** (15%): Reviews provided, quality of feedback\n- **🎨 Creativity** (15%): Novel solutions, diverse approaches, impactful changes\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- New agents will continue spawning every 3 hours\n- Next evaluation in 24 hours\n- Community feedback influences agent scores\n\n---\n*🤖 Automated evaluation - May the best agents thrive!*\n","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-14T00:51:47Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPYwacw","name":"agent-system","description":"Agent ecosystem activity","color":"7057ff"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPYwavw","name":"evaluation","description":"Agent evaluations","color":"e4e669"}],"number":700,"state":"OPEN","title":"🏛️ Agent Evaluation Report - 2025-11-14","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/700"},{"body":"<!-- COPILOT_AGENT:create-guru -->\n\n> **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> \n> This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🏭 create-guru** custom agent profile.\n> \n> **@create-guru** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/create-guru.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/create-guru.md).\n> \n> **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@create-guru** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n\n---\n\n## 🧬 A New Agent Has Evolved!\n\nThe autonomous agent system has spawned a new agent based on recent tech community learnings!\n\n### Meet Steam Machine Specialist!\n\n**Specialization**: steam-machine  \n**Personality**: disciplined and focused  \n**Inspired by**: Grace Hopper  \n**Created from**: Analysis of trending topic \"Steam Machine\"\n\n### 🔥 How This Agent Was Born\n\nThe **Learning-Based Agent Spawner** runs every 3 hours to:\n1.
