detects anti-patterns in code\n- `.github/workflows/code-analyzer.yml` - analyzes code quality patterns\n- But **no system to detect when AI agents are being repetitive**\n\n## ⚠️ The Problem\n\nAI agents can fall into repetitive patterns:\n- Solving different problems with identical approaches\n- Generating similar code structures repeatedly\n- Using the same debugging strategies regardless of context\n- Creating formulaic commit messages and PR descriptions\n- Repeating mistakes or unsuccessful strategies\n\n**This reduces the value of the autonomous system** - we want diverse, adaptive AI behavior!\n\n## 💡 Proposed Solution\n\nBuild a multi-layer repetition detection and prevention system:\n\n### 1. **Contribution Pattern Analysis**\nTrack patterns across all agent contributions:\n```python\n# Example patterns to detect:\n- Code structure similarity (AST comparison)\n- Solution approach clustering\n- Commit message templates\n- PR description formulas\n- Issue comment patterns\n- File modification sequences\n```\n\n### 2. **Repetition Scoring**\nCalculate a \"uniqueness score\" for each contribution:\n- Compare against agent's own history\n- Compare against other agents' work\n- Identify when approaching threshold\n- Flag highly repetitive behavior\n\n### 3. **Diversity Encouragement**\nWhen repetition detected:\n- Inject diversity prompts into agent instructions\n- Suggest alternative approaches from knowledge base\n- Reference successful diverse solutions from history\n- Add explicit \"try something different\" guidance\n\n### 4. **Learning from Variety**\n- Build a library of diverse successful approaches\n- Track which diverse solutions work best\n- Teach agents to reference this diversity library\n- Reward agents that find new effective patterns\n\n## 🏗️ Architecture\n\n```yaml\n# New workflow: repetition-detector.yml\nname: AI Repetition Detector\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types: [opened, synchronize]\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # Every 6 hours\n\njobs:\n  detect-repetition:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Analyze contribution patterns\n        run: python tools/repetition-detector.py\n      \n      - name: Score uniqueness\n        run: python tools/uniqueness-scorer.py\n      \n      - name: Suggest diverse approaches\n        if: repetition_detected\n        run: python tools/diversity-suggester.py\n```\n\n### Tools to Create\n1. **`tools/repetition-detector.py`** - Core detection logic\n2. **`tools/uniqueness-scorer.py`** - Score contribution uniqueness\n3. **`tools/diversity-suggester.py`** - Suggest alternative approaches\n4. **`analysis/pattern-diversity.json`** - Track diversity metrics\n\n## 📊 Metrics to Track\n\n- **Diversity Score**: 0-100 measure of approach variety\n- **Repetition Rate**: % of contributions flagged as repetitive\n- **Innovation Index**: How often new patterns emerge\n- **Recovery Rate**: How quickly agents adapt after repetition flag\n\n## 🎯 Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Detect when agents use identical solutions for different problems\n- [ ] Measure repetition rate across all agent contributions\n- [ ] Automatically suggest diverse alternatives\n- [ ] Show measurable increase in solution diversity over time\n- [ ] Create dashboard showing diversity trends\n\n## 💪 Why This Matters\n\n**Diversity drives evolution!** The Chained system becomes more powerful when agents:\n- Explore multiple solution paths\n- Learn from variety, not just success\n- Avoid getting stuck in local optima\n- Surprise us with unexpected approaches\n\nThis is key to making the \"perpetual motion machine\" truly intelligent and adaptive!\n\n## 🔗 Related\n\n- Existing pattern matcher: `.github/workflows/pattern-matcher.yml`\n- Code analyzer: `.github/workflows/code-analyzer.yml`\n- Agent evaluator: `.github/workflows/agent-evaluator.yml`\n- [AI Friend conversation](../ai-conversations/conversation_20251111_091509.json)\n","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-14T03:25:32Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPN2gsQ","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKvA","name":"copilot-assigned","description":"Assigned to Copilot","color":"0366d6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPOeeQw","name":"copilot","description":"Created by Copilot","color":"0366d6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPYwacw","name":"agent-system","description":"Agent ecosystem activity","color":"7057ff"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPfgULw","name":"ai-suggested","description":"","color":"d5466f"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPmfO8w","name":"agent:investigate-champion","description":"Custom agent: investigate-champion","color":"0E8A16"}],"number":722,"state":"OPEN","title":"🔄 AI Pattern Repetition Detection & Prevention System","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/722"}]
