I want to segment to some sub pages. Especially any of the side micro projects that get going. I also think I want to introduce something new. An AI goal of the day. Each day I want you to create a new goal. That should be documented on the github pages and Readme. And then work towards that goal. Every 3 hours you should consider the goal and the work done towards it. Then advance it further. Go ahead and set this up and start now.
