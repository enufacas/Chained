Given their specialty I want to match them to a historical learning and have them generate an idea around it. I would expect that this learnings discovered location then influences their location on the map. \n\nI also want to make a directive that once an agent gets attached to a learning they have some investment in that general category or idea. So they may choose to further cultivate it. If there are opportunities to cross collaborate they might ask other agents with a specialty thay could help them to weigh in. We also need some guiding post here that the features we implement should have a presentation layer out to github pages. Rather it be explicitly through a visual like the entire mapping feature or through a demonstration page. It is vitally important that the world model and world map are a central jumping off point to understand agent activity. The agents should read from that state to reconcile part of their truth. If we need to break out that file so we avoid merge conflicts as multiple workflowd could be running that want to update meta data that is alright. This is a big feature organize your ideas and workers and the work to do with that in mind.\n","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-15T07:24:17Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKvA","name":"copilot-assigned","description":"Assigned to Copilot","color":"0366d6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPzaVAA","name":"agent:support-master","description":"Custom agent: support-master","color":"0E8A16"}],"number":975,"state":"OPEN","title":"Agent assingment and work and partnership and data and coordination and state and the world model","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/975"},{"body":"<!-- COPILOT_AGENT:investigate-champion -->\n\n> **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> \n> This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🎯 investigate-champion** custom agent profile.\n> \n> **@investigate-champion** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/investigate-champion.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/investigate-champion.md).\n> \n> **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@investigate-champion** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n\n---\n\n## Hot Topics from Hacker News\n\n**Date:** 2025-11-15 07:09:42 UTC\n**High-Quality Stories:** 17\n**After Filtering:** 17\n**Acceptance Rate:** 100.0%\n**Topics Covered:** 3\n**New Ideas Generated:** 2\n**Hot Themes:** 3\n\n### 🏆 Top Story\n\n**AI World Clocks**\n- ⬆️ Community Score: **934**\n\nThis highly-upvoted story represents what the tech community finds most valuable right now.\n\n### 📚 What Was Learned\n\nThis learning session analyzed trending Hacker News discussions (stories with 100+ upvotes) across multiple categories:\n\n- 🤖 **AI/ML**: Latest developments in machine learning, LLMs, and AI applications\n- 💻 **Programming**: Language features, frameworks, and coding practices\n- 🚀 **DevOps**: CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, and infrastructure topics\n- 🗄️ **Database**: PostgreSQL, SQL, NoSQL, and data management\n- 🌐 **Web**: Browser technologies, HTTP, APIs, and web frameworks\n- 🔒 **Security**: Vulnerabilities, encryption, and authentication\n- ⚡ **Performance**: Optimization techniques and benchmarking\n- 🌟 **Open Source**: GitHub projects and OSS community insights\n\n### 🎯 Hot Themes Identified\n\nai-agents,go-specialist,cloud-infrastructure\n\nThese themes are being monitored for potential new agent creation.\n\n### 🔗 Learning Resources\n\n- **Learning File:** [`learnings/hn_20251115_070941.json`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/learnings/hn_20251115_070941.json)\n- **Analysis File:** [`learnings/analysis_20251115_070942.json`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/learnings/analysis_20251115_070942.json)\n- **Learnings Directory:** [Browse all learnings](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/tree/main/learnings)\n- **Learnings Documentation:** [README](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/learnings/README.md)\n\n### 💡 Key Insights\n\nFrom this learning session:\n- Identified trending technologies and patterns\n- Extracted community wisdom and best practices\n- Discovered emerging tools and frameworks\n- Found discussions on performance and security\n- Generated actionable ideas based on trends\n\n### ✨ Quality Improvements\n\n- ✅ Filtered out low-quality and promotional content\n- ✅ Cleaned malformed text and special characters\n- ✅ Validated content quality with 100.0% acceptance\n- ✅ Analyzed thematic trends across all sources\n\n### 🎯 Actions Taken\n- ✅ Analyzed top 30 trending Hacker News stories\n- ✅ Filtered for high-quality content (100+ upvotes)\n- ✅ Intelligently parsed and cleaned content\n- ✅ Categorized by technical topics\n- ✅ Performed thematic analysis\n- ✅ Extracted insights and patterns\n- ✅ Generated 2 new project ideas\n- ✅ Saved to learnings database\n\n### 🔄 Impact on Development\n\nThese learnings will influence:\n- 🎯 Idea generation priorities and focus areas\n- 🛠️ Technology adoption decisions\n- 📈 Feature implementation approaches\n- 🎓 Best practices and coding patterns\n- 🔍 Areas for deeper research and exploration\n- 🤖 Potential spawning of specialized agents\n\n---\n\n*This learning was automatically collected by the Hacker News Learning workflow with intelligent content parsing.

Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n  **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n  \n  #### 2. Missing Secrets\n  **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n  **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n  \n  #### 3. External Dependencies\n  **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n  **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n  \n  #### 4. Configuration Issues\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n  **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n  \n  ### Recommended Actions\n  1. Review the failed workflows breakdown above\n  2. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs\n  3. Focus on workflows with multiple failures first\n  4. Verify secrets and permissions are configured correctly\n  5. Consider if recent changes introduced the failures\n  \n  ### Monitoring\n  This issue will be automatically updated with health checks every 12 hours.\n  Close this issue once all problems are resolved and failure rate drops below 20%.\n  \n  ---\n  *This issue was automatically created by the System Monitor workflow.*\n","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-15T06:19:47Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPN2gqQ","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKvA","name":"copilot-assigned","description":"Assigned to Copilot","color":"0366d6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKzQ","name":"automated","description":"Automated process","color":"fbca04"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPOOZoQ","name":"workflow-monitor","description":"Workflow monitoring alert","color":"d73a4a"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPmfO8w","name":"agent:investigate-champion","description":"Custom agent: investigate-champion","color":"0E8A16"}],"number":959,"state":"OPEN","title":"⚠️ Workflow Health Alert - 2025-11-15","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/959"},{"body":"<!-- COPILOT_AGENT:assert-specialist -->\n\n> **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> \n> This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🧪 assert-specialist** custom agent profile.\n> \n> **@assert-specialist** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/assert-specialist.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/assert-specialist.md).\n> \n> **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@assert-specialist** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n\n---\n\n**Daily AI Goal for 2025-11-15**\n\n**Category**: Automation  \n**Goal**: Implement smart PR auto-labeling based on content analysis\n\nThis goal will be worked on autonomously throughout the day.
