[{"body":"## Workflow Health Monitoring Alert\n  \n  The workflow monitor has detected issues that require attention.\n  \n  **Detection Time:** 2025-11-22 01:02:50 UTC\n  \n  ### Health Summary\n  - **Total Workflow Runs:** 100 (last 100 sampled)\n  - **Completed Runs:** 44 (success + failure)\n  - **Failed Runs:** 27\n  - **Failure Rate:** 61.4% (of completed runs)\n  \n  ### Failed Workflows Breakdown\n  - **.github/workflows/generate-reviewer-dashboard.yml**: 5 failure(s)\n- **.github/workflows/review-criteria-learning.yml**: 5 failure(s)\n- **.github/workflows/validate-instructions-size.yml**: 9 failure(s)\n- **AI Pattern**:  Repetition Detector:1 failure(s)\n- **Automation**:  Auto Review & Merge:1 failure(s)\n- **CI**:  Workflow Validation:1 failure(s)\n- **Goal and Idea System**: 1 failure(s)\n- **Mentorship Monitoring Dashboard**: 1 failure(s)\n- **Running Copilot**: 3 failure(s)\n  \n  ### 🔧 Quick Fix: Missing Labels (Most Common Issue)\n  \n  **If you see label-related errors**, run this quick fix:\n  \n  ```bash\n  # Option 1: Run locally\n  bash scripts/fix-workflow-labels.sh\n  \n  # Option 2: Trigger workflow manually\n  # Go to Actions → \"Maintenance: Ensure Repository Labels Exist\" → Run workflow\n  ```\n  \n  **@troubleshoot-expert** has added fallback logic to all workflows, so they'll create PRs without labels if needed.\n  \n  ### Common Causes & Solutions\n  \n  #### 1. Missing Repository Labels ⭐ MOST COMMON\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail with `could not add label: 'code-quality' not found`\n  **Solution:** \n  - Run `bash scripts/fix-workflow-labels.sh` to create labels\n  - Or trigger the \"Ensure Repository Labels Exist\" workflow manually\n  - Workflows now have fallback logic and won't fail completely\n  \n  #### 2. Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n  **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n  \n  #### 3. Missing Secrets\n  **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n  **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n  \n  #### 4. External Dependencies\n  **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n  **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n  \n  #### 5. Configuration Issues\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n  **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n  \n  ### Recommended Actions\n  1. **First:** Check if label-related (see Quick Fix above)\n  2. Review the failed workflows breakdown above\n  3. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs\n  4. Focus on workflows with multiple failures first\n  5. Verify secrets and permissions are configured correctly\n  6. Consider if recent changes introduced the failures\n  \n  ### Documentation\n  - 📖 **Troubleshooting Guide:** `.github/workflows/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`\n  - 🔧 **Quick Fix Script:** `scripts/fix-workflow-labels.sh`\n  - 🏷️ **Label Tool:** `tools/create_labels.py`\n  \n  ### Monitoring\n  This issue will be automatically updated with health checks every 12 hours.\n  Close this issue once all problems are resolved and failure rate drops below 20%.\n  \n  ---\n  *This issue was automatically created by the System Monitor workflow.*\n  *Fixes by **@troubleshoot-expert*** 🔧","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-22T01:02:51Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPN2gqQ","name":"bug","description":"Bug or error fix","color":"D73A4A"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKzQ","name":"automated","description":"Automated workflow action","color":"E99695"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPOOZoQ","name":"workflow-monitor","description":"Workflow monitoring alert","color":"d73a4a"}],"number":2283,"state":"OPEN","title":"⚠️ Workflow Health Alert - 2025-11-22","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/2283"},{"body":"## AI Agent Diversity Alert\n\nThe uniqueness scoring system has identified AI agents with diversity scores below the threshold.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Agents Below Threshold:** 1\n- **Average Uniqueness Score:** 32.0\n- **Threshold:** 30.0\n- **Analysis Period:** Last 30 days\n\n### Agents Needing Improvement:\n- **enufacas**: Score 27.39 - low approach diversity (16.0); low innovation index (0.0)\n\n### What This Means:\nLow diversity scores may indicate:\n- Agents falling into habitual approaches\n- Limited variety in problem-solving strategies\n- Opportunities for broader skill application\n- Potential for more innovative solutions\n\n### Action Items:\n1. **Review Diversity Suggestions**: Check `analysis/diversity-suggestions.md` for specific recommendations\n2. **Examine Recent Work**: Look at flagged agents' recent contributions to identify patterns\n3. **Encourage Exploration**: Consider assigning diverse types of issues to these agents\n4. **Learn from High Performers**: Share successful diverse patterns from agents above threshold\n\n### Analysis Reports:\n- 📊 **Repetition Patterns**: `analysis/repetition-report.json` - Code structure and commit patterns\n- 🎯 **Uniqueness Scores**: `analysis/uniqueness-scores.json` - Agent diversity metrics\n- 💡 **Improvement Suggestions**: `analysis/diversity-suggestions.md` - Actionable recommendations\n\n### Note:\nThis alert focuses on **AI agent diversity**, not code quality.
