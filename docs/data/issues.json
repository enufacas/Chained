**Total Workflow Runs:** 100 (last 100 sampled)\n  - **Completed Runs:** 59 (success + failure)\n  - **Failed Runs:** 16\n  - **Failure Rate:** 27.1% (of completed runs)\n  \n  ### Failed Workflows Breakdown\n  - **Addressing comment on PR #2168**: 1 failure(s)\n- **Addressing comment on PR #2174**: 1 failure(s)\n- **Autonomous A/B Testing**: 1 failure(s)\n- **Cleanup**:  Old Learning Files:1 failure(s)\n- **Learning**:  Git Commit Strategies:1 failure(s)\n- **Meta-Agent Coordination**: 7 failure(s)\n- **Review Criteria Learning**: 1 failure(s)\n- **Running Copilot**: 3 failure(s)\n  \n  ### 🔧 Quick Fix: Missing Labels (Most Common Issue)\n  \n  **If you see label-related errors**, run this quick fix:\n  \n  ```bash\n  # Option 1: Run locally\n  bash scripts/fix-workflow-labels.sh\n  \n  # Option 2: Trigger workflow manually\n  # Go to Actions → \"Maintenance: Ensure Repository Labels Exist\" → Run workflow\n  ```\n  \n  **@troubleshoot-expert** has added fallback logic to all workflows, so they'll create PRs without labels if needed.\n  \n  ### Common Causes & Solutions\n  \n  #### 1. Missing Repository Labels ⭐ MOST COMMON\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail with `could not add label: 'code-quality' not found`\n  **Solution:** \n  - Run `bash scripts/fix-workflow-labels.sh` to create labels\n  - Or trigger the \"Ensure Repository Labels Exist\" workflow manually\n  - Workflows now have fallback logic and won't fail completely\n  \n  #### 2. Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n  **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n  \n  #### 3. Missing Secrets\n  **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n  **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n  \n  #### 4. External Dependencies\n  **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n  **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n  \n  #### 5. Configuration Issues\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n  **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n  \n  ### Recommended Actions\n  1. **First:** Check if label-related (see Quick Fix above)\n  2. Review the failed workflows breakdown above\n  3. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs\n  4. Focus on workflows with multiple failures first\n  5. Verify secrets and permissions are configured correctly\n  6. Consider if recent changes introduced the failures\n  \n  ### Documentation\n  - 📖 **Troubleshooting Guide:** `.github/workflows/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`\n  - 🔧 **Quick Fix Script:** `scripts/fix-workflow-labels.sh`\n  - 🏷️ **Label Tool:** `tools/create_labels.py`\n  \n  ### Monitoring\n  This issue will be automatically updated with health checks every 12 hours.\n  Close this issue once all problems are resolved and failure rate drops below 20%.\n  \n  ---\n  *This issue was automatically created by the System Monitor workflow.*\n  *Fixes by **@troubleshoot-expert*** 🔧\n","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-21T03:40:06Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPN2gqQ","name":"bug","description":"Bug or error fix","color":"D73A4A"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKvA","name":"copilot-assigned","description":"Assigned to Copilot","color":"0366d6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKzQ","name":"automated","description":"Automated workflow action","color":"E99695"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPOOZoQ","name":"workflow-monitor","description":"Workflow monitoring alert","color":"d73a4a"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACP27rhA","name":"agent:troubleshoot-expert","description":"Assigned to troubleshoot-expert agent","color":"1D76DB"}],"number":2182,"state":"OPEN","title":"⚠️ Workflow Health Alert - 2025-11-21","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/2182"},{"body":"<!-- COPILOT_AGENT:accelerate-master -->\n\n> **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> \n> This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **📈 accelerate-master** custom agent profile.\n> \n> **@accelerate-master** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/accelerate-master.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/accelerate-master.md).\n> \n> **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@accelerate-master** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n\n---\n\nI want to make the site faster\n","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-21T03:21:12Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKvA","name":"copilot-assigned","description":"Assigned to Copilot","color":"0366d6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPzHH4w","name":"agent:accelerate-master","description":"Assigned to accelerate-master agent","color":"1D76DB"}],"number":2180,"state":"OPEN","title":"This is a vague issue","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/2180"},{"body":"<!-- COPILOT_AGENT:investigate-champion -->\n\n> **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> \n> This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🎯 Ada** (@investigate-champion) custom agent profile.\n> \n> **@investigate-champion** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/investigate-champion.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/investigate-champion.md).\n> \n> **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@investigate-champion** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Git Commit Strategy Analysis\n\nThe system has analyzed git commit patterns from the repository.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Branch Analyzed: main\n- Days Analyzed: 30\n- Commits Analyzed: 500\n- Insights Extracted: 1\n\n**Sample Insight:** Commit success rate: 100.0%\n\n**Learning File:** `learnings/commit_strategies_20251121_030445.json`\n\nThis analysis helps improve commit strategies by learning from repository history.\n\n---\n\n*Automated analysis by @workflows-tech-lead*\n","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-21T03:04:47Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKvA","name":"copilot-assigned","description":"Assigned to Copilot","color":"0366d6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKzQ","name":"automated","description":"Automated workflow action","color":"E99695"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODK8g","name":"learning","description":"Learning system activity","color":"0E8A16"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPOeeQw","name":"copilot","description":"Work assigned to GitHub Copilot","color":"3B82F6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPmfO8w","name":"agent:investigate-champion","description":"Assigned to investigate-champion agent","color":"1D76DB"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACP3JEdA","name":"analysis","description":"","color":"4b51f0"}],"number":2178,"state":"OPEN","title":"📊 Learned Optimal Git Commit Strategies - 2025-11-21","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/2178"},{"body":"<!-- COPILOT_AGENT:troubleshoot-expert -->\n\n> **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> \n> This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🔧 troubleshoot-expert** custom agent profile.\n> \n> **@troubleshoot-expert** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/troubleshoot-expert.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/troubleshoot-expert.md).\n> \n> **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@troubleshoot-expert** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n\n---\n\nhttps://github.com/enufacas/Chained/pull/2171\n\nIssues of this type can chain back to back.
