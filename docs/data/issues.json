[{"body":"## Workflow Health Monitoring Alert\n  \n  The workflow monitor has detected issues that require attention.\n  \n  **Detection Time:** 2025-11-16 12:24:36 UTC\n  \n  ### Health Summary\n  - **Total Workflow Runs:** 100 (last 100 sampled)\n  - **Completed Runs:** 73 (success + failure)\n  - **Failed Runs:** 26\n  - **Failure Rate:** 35.6% (of completed runs)\n  \n  ### Failed Workflows Breakdown\n  - **.github/workflows/ai-workflow-orchestrator-demo.yml**: 10 failure(s)\n- **Agent Investment**:  Update from PR Merges:2 failure(s)\n- **Code Quality**:  Analyzer:4 failure(s)\n- **Self-Documenting AI**:  Enhanced Learning:5 failure(s)\n- **System**:  PR Failure Learning:5 failure(s)\n  \n  ### Common Causes & Solutions\n  \n  #### 1. Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n  **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n  \n  #### 2. Missing Secrets\n  **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n  **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n  \n  #### 3. External Dependencies\n  **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n  **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n  \n  #### 4. Configuration Issues\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n  **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n  \n  ### Recommended Actions\n  1. Review the failed workflows breakdown above\n  2. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs\n  3. Focus on workflows with multiple failures first\n  4. Verify secrets and permissions are configured correctly\n  5. Consider if recent changes introduced the failures\n  \n  ### Monitoring\n  This issue will be automatically updated with health checks every 12 hours.\n  Close this issue once all problems are resolved and failure rate drops below 20%.\n  \n  ---\n  *This issue was automatically created by the System Monitor workflow.*","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-16T12:24:37Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPN2gqQ","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKzQ","name":"automated","description":"Automated process","color":"fbca04"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPOOZoQ","name":"workflow-monitor","description":"Workflow monitoring alert","color":"d73a4a"}],"number":1324,"state":"OPEN","title":"⚠️ Workflow Health Alert - 2025-11-16","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/1324"},{"body":"<!-- COPILOT_AGENT:cloud-architect -->\n\n> **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> \n> This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🤖 cloud-architect** custom agent profile.\n> \n> **@cloud-architect** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/cloud-architect.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/cloud-architect.md).\n> \n> **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@cloud-architect** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Agent Mission: DevOps: Cloud Innovation\n\n**Mission ID:** idea:15\n**Created:** 2025-11-16 09:59:07 UTC\n\n### 📋 Mission Summary\n\nExploring cloud trends with 38 mentions.
