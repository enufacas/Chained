It is not collapsible at all right now.\n\nWithin the 3d landscape we need to show more pipelines. Also any agent not depicted in a pipeline needs to have a body and all be hanging out in crowds. The hall of farmers should have the own special section. The tech leads should also have their own section. \n\nThere are some instances where I only see the name label and not the humanoid representation thay is a problem. Always show both humanoids and label. \n\nIncreas the number of pipelines shown and make sure to arrange them in a grid pattern the pipeline animation should produce bits of code that are sized based on the number of lines in the PR. It should be easier to read the PR numbers and include the name of the PR. Make it clickable to open the PR.\n","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-20T03:22:03Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKvA","name":"copilot-assigned","description":"Assigned to Copilot","color":"0366d6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACQDLuFQ","name":"agent:render-3d-master","description":"Custom agent: render-3d-master","color":"0E8A16"}],"number":2031,"state":"OPEN","title":"Organism page","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/2031"},{"body":"<!-- COPILOT_AGENT:APIs-architect -->\n\n> **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> \n> This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🏭 APIs-architect** custom agent profile.\n> \n> **@APIs-architect** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/APIs-architect.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/APIs-architect.md).\n> \n> **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@APIs-architect** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n\n---\n\nhttps://enufacas.github.io/Chained/workflow-schedule.html based on the latest system state\n","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-20T03:11:35Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKvA","name":"copilot-assigned","description":"Assigned to Copilot","color":"0366d6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACQDYMSw","name":"agent:APIs-architect","description":"Custom agent: APIs-architect","color":"0E8A16"}],"number":2028,"state":"OPEN","title":"Update the workflow page ","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/2028"},{"body":"## 📊 Git Commit Strategy Analysis\n\nThe system has analyzed git commit patterns from the repository.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Branch Analyzed: main\n- Days Analyzed: 30\n- Commits Analyzed: 500\n- Insights Extracted: 1\n\n**Sample Insight:** Commit success rate: 100.0%\n\n**Learning File:** `learnings/commit_strategies_20251120_030350.json`\n\nThis analysis helps improve commit strategies by learning from repository history.\n\n---\n\n*Automated analysis by @workflows-tech-lead*\n","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-20T03:03:51Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKzQ","name":"automated","description":"Automated workflow action","color":"E99695"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODK8g","name":"learning","description":"Learning system activity","color":"0E8A16"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPOeeQw","name":"copilot","description":"Work assigned to GitHub Copilot","color":"3B82F6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACP3JEdA","name":"analysis","description":"","color":"4b51f0"}],"number":2024,"state":"OPEN","title":"📊 Learned Optimal Git Commit Strategies - 2025-11-20","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/2024"},{"body":"<!-- COPILOT_AGENT:APIs-architect -->\n\n> **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> \n> This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🏭 APIs-architect** custom agent profile.\n> \n> **@APIs-architect** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/APIs-architect.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/APIs-architect.md).\n> \n> **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@APIs-architect** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n\n---\n\nhttps://github.com/enufacas/Chained/pull/1891 \n\nThis workflow has a bad design and frequently queues up open PRs that are then in conflict because they attempt to write to the same file.

Missing Repository Labels ⭐ MOST COMMON\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail with `could not add label: 'code-quality' not found`\n  **Solution:** \n  - Run `bash scripts/fix-workflow-labels.sh` to create labels\n  - Or trigger the \"Ensure Repository Labels Exist\" workflow manually\n  - Workflows now have fallback logic and won't fail completely\n  \n  #### 2. Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n  **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n  \n  #### 3. Missing Secrets\n  **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n  **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n  \n  #### 4. External Dependencies\n  **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n  **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n  \n  #### 5. Configuration Issues\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n  **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n  \n  ### Recommended Actions\n  1. **First:** Check if label-related (see Quick Fix above)\n  2. Review the failed workflows breakdown above\n  3. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs\n  4. Focus on workflows with multiple failures first\n  5. Verify secrets and permissions are configured correctly\n  6. Consider if recent changes introduced the failures\n  \n  ### Documentation\n  - 📖 **Troubleshooting Guide:** `.github/workflows/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`\n  - 🔧 **Quick Fix Script:** `scripts/fix-workflow-labels.sh`\n  - 🏷️ **Label Tool:** `tools/create_labels.py`\n  \n  ### Monitoring\n  This issue will be automatically updated with health checks every 12 hours.\n  Close this issue once all problems are resolved and failure rate drops below 20%.\n  \n  ---\n  *This issue was automatically created by the System Monitor workflow.*\n  *Fixes by **@troubleshoot-expert*** 🔧\n","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-19T01:05:33Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPN2gqQ","name":"bug","description":"Bug or error fix","color":"D73A4A"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKvA","name":"copilot-assigned","description":"Assigned to Copilot","color":"0366d6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKzQ","name":"automated","description":"Automated workflow action","color":"E99695"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPOOZoQ","name":"workflow-monitor","description":"Workflow monitoring alert","color":"d73a4a"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACQDadfw","name":"agent:workflows-tech-lead","description":"Custom agent: workflows-tech-lead","color":"0E8A16"}],"number":1840,"state":"OPEN","title":"⚠️ Workflow Health Alert - 2025-11-19","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/1840"}]
