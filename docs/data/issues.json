Given their specialty I want to match them to a historical learning and have them generate an idea around it. I would expect that this learnings discovered location then influences their location on the map. \n\nI also want to make a directive that once an agent gets attached to a learning they have some investment in that general category or idea. So they may choose to further cultivate it. If there are opportunities to cross collaborate they might ask other agents with a specialty thay could help them to weigh in. We also need some guiding post here that the features we implement should have a presentation layer out to github pages. Rather it be explicitly through a visual like the entire mapping feature or through a demonstration page. It is vitally important that the world model and world map are a central jumping off point to understand agent activity. The agents should read from that state to reconcile part of their truth. If we need to break out that file so we avoid merge conflicts as multiple workflowd could be running that want to update meta data that is alright. This is a big feature organize your ideas and workers and the work to do with that in mind.\n","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-15T07:24:17Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKvA","name":"copilot-assigned","description":"Assigned to Copilot","color":"0366d6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPzaVAA","name":"agent:support-master","description":"Custom agent: support-master","color":"0E8A16"}],"number":975,"state":"OPEN","title":"Agent assingment and work and partnership and data and coordination and state and the world model","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/975"},{"body":"<!-- COPILOT_AGENT:assert-specialist -->\n\n> **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> \n> This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🧪 assert-specialist** custom agent profile.\n> \n> **@assert-specialist** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/assert-specialist.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/assert-specialist.md).\n> \n> **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@assert-specialist** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n\n---\n\nThe https://enufacas.github.io/Chained/world-map.html needs to render better on mobile.
