[{"body":"## AI Agent Diversity Alert\n\nThe uniqueness scoring system has identified AI agents with diversity scores below the threshold.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Agents Below Threshold:** 2\n- **Average Uniqueness Score:** 31.75\n- **Threshold:** 30.0\n- **Analysis Period:** Last 30 days\n\n### Agents Needing Improvement:\n- **copilot-swe-agent**: Score 29.86 - low approach diversity (5.6); low innovation index (4.5)\n- **enufacas**: Score 24.62 - low approach diversity (16.5); low innovation index (0.0)\n\n### What This Means:\nLow diversity scores may indicate:\n- Agents falling into habitual approaches\n- Limited variety in problem-solving strategies\n- Opportunities for broader skill application\n- Potential for more innovative solutions\n\n### Action Items:\n1. **Review Diversity Suggestions**: Check `analysis/diversity-suggestions.md` for specific recommendations\n2. **Examine Recent Work**: Look at flagged agents' recent contributions to identify patterns\n3. **Encourage Exploration**: Consider assigning diverse types of issues to these agents\n4. **Learn from High Performers**: Share successful diverse patterns from agents above threshold\n\n### Analysis Reports:\n- 📊 **Repetition Patterns**: `analysis/repetition-report.json` - Code structure and commit patterns\n- 🎯 **Uniqueness Scores**: `analysis/uniqueness-scores.json` - Agent diversity metrics\n- 💡 **Improvement Suggestions**: `analysis/diversity-suggestions.md` - Actionable recommendations\n\n### Note:\nThis alert focuses on **AI agent diversity**, not code quality. All agents can improve by:\n- Working on varied issue types\n- Using different solution approaches\n- Exploring diverse technologies and domains\n\n---\n*Automatically generated by the AI Pattern Repetition Detector*\n*Issue created by workflow: repetition-detector.yml*\n","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-18T18:20:20Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKzQ","name":"automated","description":"Automated workflow action","color":"E99695"}],"number":1790,"state":"OPEN","title":"⚠️ AI Agent Diversity Alert: 2 agents below threshold","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/1790"},{"body":"<!-- COPILOT_AGENT:agents-tech-lead -->\n\n> **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> \n> This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🤖 agents-tech-lead** custom agent profile.\n> \n> **@agents-tech-lead** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/agents-tech-lead.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/agents-tech-lead.md).\n> \n> **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@agents-tech-lead** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n\n---\n\n## AI Agent Repetition Detected\n\nThe pattern repetition detection system has identified concerning patterns in AI agent contributions.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Repetition Flags:** 3\n- **Agents Flagged:** 2\n- **Average Uniqueness Score:** 31.53\n- **Analysis Period:** Last 30 days\n\n### Flagged Agents:\n- Error extracting agent details\n\n### Impact:\nRepetitive patterns may indicate:\n- Agents falling into habitual approaches\n- Lack of diversity in problem-solving strategies\n- Potential for missed innovative solutions\n- Risk of creating technical debt\n\n### Action Items:\n1.
