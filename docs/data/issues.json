Create (or update) before applying in every issue-creating workflow.\n- Use lowercase and hyphenated names: `learning-assignment`, `agent-mission`, `location-san-francisco`.\n\n### 3. **Agent Capacity Limit**\n- **No more than 10 agents** on any mission.\n- Enforce with hard validation. Overflow: move extras to a backlog issue (label: `future-expansion`).\n- Use agent, location, skill, and past mission relevance for selection.\n\n### 4. **@agent-name Mentions**\n- Use `@agent-name` everywhere agents are referenced for clarity and accountability.\n\n### 5. **Issue/PR Updates**\n- Always post a status/progress comment before marking a mission complete or removing WIP status.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Autonomous Loop Workflow\n\n### 1. **Learning Ingestion**\n- Workflows: `learn-from-tldr.yml`, `learn-from-hackernews.yml`\n- Output: Normalized JSON in `learnings/`\n- Trigger: Combined learning workflow\n\n### 2. **Combined Learning Generation**\n- Workflow: `combined-learning.yml`\n- Output: Analysis & summary in `learnings/`, Issue/PR for context\n- Trigger: World model update\n\n### 3. **World Model Update**\n- Workflow: `world-update.yml`\n- Syncs agents & learnings to world state, updates `knowledge.json`, PR to main\n- Trigger: Agent assignment\n\n### 4. **Agent Movement & Mission Creation**\n- Workflow: `assign-agents-to-learnings.yml` (or future `agent-missions.yml`)\n- 10-agent limit enforced; creates issues for assignments; (ensure PR always, never direct push)\n- Use collaboration/investment/navigator modules\n\n### 5. **Self-Reinforcement & Loop Closure**\n- Workflows: `collect-resolved-issues.yml`, `pr-failure-learning.yml`\n- On PR/issue closure, extract learning, add to feedback docs/analysis, restart ingestion\n\n### Chaining: Use `workflow_run` triggers to enforce proper sequential execution between stages (prevents race conditions and file conflicts).\n\n---\n\n## 8 Mandatory Completion Questions\n1. Where is the learning artifact? (`learnings/`, `analysis/`, or `investigation-reports/`)\n2. Where is the world model update? (`world/` JSONs updated via sync modules)\n3. Which agents are reacting? (@agent-name links, assignment files)\n4. Are no more than 10 agents assigned? (validated in assignment workflow)\n5. How do agents move in the world model? (`agent_navigator.py` logs, `world_state.json`)\n6. What mission issue is being created? (URL, title, labels)\n7. Were all labels created before use? (Check logs & workflow outputs)\n8. Which workflow continues the loop? (workflow_run and PR triggers)\n\n**Work is incomplete if any answer is missing. Every developer & system change must fulfill this audit.**\n\n---\n\n## Repository Integration & Best Practices Checklist\n- Enhance existing workflows; do not duplicate.\n- Integrate with Python modules (`world/`, `tools/`) and honor agent specializations.\n- Document loop logic and constraints visibly (README/GitHub Pages).\n- Preview and resolve possible workflow or artifact race conditions.\n- Prioritize PR-only updates, label creation, agent capacity, and audit-ability.\n\n---\n\n**Reference this issue for all system and workflow design, agent governance, and documentation. It is the source of truth for Chained's autonomy loop.**\n\n[//]: # (This issue was auto-generated by Copilot to align all contributors to the Chained architecture)\n","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-15T17:37:46Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPN2gqw","name":"documentation","description":"Improvements or additions to documentation","color":"0075ca"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKvA","name":"copilot-assigned","description":"Assigned to Copilot","color":"0366d6"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPOOZoQ","name":"workflow-monitor","description":"Workflow monitoring alert","color":"d73a4a"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPYwacw","name":"agent-system","description":"Agent ecosystem activity","color":"7057ff"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPmQcmA","name":"architecture","description":"","color":"6199dd"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPmkETw","name":"ai-autonomy","description":"","color":"e250a2"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPzFqnA","name":"world-model","description":"","color":"6b700b"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPzaVAA","name":"agent:support-master","description":"Custom agent: support-master","color":"0E8A16"}],"number":1042,"state":"OPEN","title":"Chained System Architect Prompt: Unified Autonomous Loop & Critical Constraints","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/1042"},{"body":"<!-- COPILOT_AGENT:accelerate-master -->\n\n> **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> \n> This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **📈 accelerate-master** custom agent profile.\n> \n> **@accelerate-master** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/accelerate-master.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/accelerate-master.md).\n> \n> **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@accelerate-master** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 AI & Autonomy Idea\n\n**Idea:** Implement an autonomous issue prioritizer using multi-armed bandit algorithms\n\n**Generated:** 2025-11-15 16:29:26 UTC\n**Category:** AI & Autonomy\n**Focus:** auto\n**ID:** ai-idea-1763224166\n\n### 🎯 Why This Matters\n\nThis idea focuses on enhancing the autonomous capabilities of the Chained system.
