[{"body":"## Workflow Health Monitoring Alert\n  \n  The workflow monitor has detected issues that require attention.\n  \n  **Detection Time:** 2025-11-18 06:28:26 UTC\n  \n  ### Health Summary\n  - **Total Workflow Runs:** 100 (last 100 sampled)\n  - **Completed Runs:** 73 (success + failure)\n  - **Failed Runs:** 38\n  - **Failure Rate:** 52.1% (of completed runs)\n  \n  ### Failed Workflows Breakdown\n  - **.github/workflows/agent-evolution.yml**: 9 failure(s)\n- **.github/workflows/autonomous-ab-testing.yml**: 9 failure(s)\n- **.github/workflows/repetition-detector.yml**: 9 failure(s)\n- **.github/workflows/tech-lead-review-poc.yml**: 4 failure(s)\n- **.github/workflows/workload-subagent-spawner.yml**: 2 failure(s)\n- **AI Pattern**:  Repetition Detector:1 failure(s)\n- **Agent System**:  Learning-Based Spawner:1 failure(s)\n- **Agent System**:  Spawner:1 failure(s)\n- **CI**:  Workflow Validation:1 failure(s)\n- **System**:  PR Failure Learning:1 failure(s)\n  \n  ### 🔧 Quick Fix: Missing Labels (Most Common Issue)\n  \n  **If you see label-related errors**, run this quick fix:\n  \n  ```bash\n  # Option 1: Run locally\n  bash scripts/fix-workflow-labels.sh\n  \n  # Option 2: Trigger workflow manually\n  # Go to Actions → \"Maintenance: Ensure Repository Labels Exist\" → Run workflow\n  ```\n  \n  **@troubleshoot-expert** has added fallback logic to all workflows, so they'll create PRs without labels if needed.\n  \n  ### Common Causes & Solutions\n  \n  #### 1. Missing Repository Labels ⭐ MOST COMMON\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail with `could not add label: 'code-quality' not found`\n  **Solution:** \n  - Run `bash scripts/fix-workflow-labels.sh` to create labels\n  - Or trigger the \"Ensure Repository Labels Exist\" workflow manually\n  - Workflows now have fallback logic and won't fail completely\n  \n  #### 2. Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n  **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n  \n  #### 3. Missing Secrets\n  **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n  **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n  \n  #### 4. External Dependencies\n  **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n  **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n  \n  #### 5. Configuration Issues\n  **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n  **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n  \n  ### Recommended Actions\n  1. **First:** Check if label-related (see Quick Fix above)\n  2. Review the failed workflows breakdown above\n  3. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs\n  4. Focus on workflows with multiple failures first\n  5. Verify secrets and permissions are configured correctly\n  6. Consider if recent changes introduced the failures\n  \n  ### Documentation\n  - 📖 **Troubleshooting Guide:** `.github/workflows/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`\n  - 🔧 **Quick Fix Script:** `scripts/fix-workflow-labels.sh`\n  - 🏷️ **Label Tool:** `tools/create_labels.py`\n  \n  ### Monitoring\n  This issue will be automatically updated with health checks every 12 hours.\n  Close this issue once all problems are resolved and failure rate drops below 20%.\n  \n  ---\n  *This issue was automatically created by the System Monitor workflow.*\n  *Fixes by **@troubleshoot-expert*** 🔧","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-18T06:28:27Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPN2gqQ","name":"bug","description":"Bug or error fix","color":"D73A4A"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPODKzQ","name":"automated","description":"Automated workflow action","color":"E99695"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQSAD6M8AAAACPOOZoQ","name":"workflow-monitor","description":"Workflow monitoring alert","color":"d73a4a"}],"number":1711,"state":"OPEN","title":"⚠️ Workflow Health Alert - 2025-11-18","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/1711"},{"body":"## AI Agent Repetition Detected\n\nThe pattern repetition detection system has identified concerning patterns in AI agent contributions.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Repetition Flags:** 3\n- **Agents Flagged:** 2\n- **Average Uniqueness Score:** 31.53\n- **Analysis Period:** Last 30 days\n\n### Flagged Agents:\n- Error extracting agent details\n\n### Impact:\nRepetitive patterns may indicate:\n- Agents falling into habitual approaches\n- Lack of diversity in problem-solving strategies\n- Potential for missed innovative solutions\n- Risk of creating technical debt\n\n### Action Items:\n1.
