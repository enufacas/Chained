We want to:\n1. Help agents \"look up and around\" at their world state before starting work\n2. Use the learnings index as useful information without context window overload\n3. Provide path-specific historical context\n\n### Plan\n\n- [ ] **Phase 1: Analysis & Design**\n  - [x] Review existing learnings data structure\n  - [x] Analyze knowledge graph format\n  - [x] Review current copilot-instructions.md structure\n  - [x] Understand `.github/instructions/` path-specific pattern\n  - [ ] Design context injection strategy\n\n- [ ] **Phase 2: Prototype Implementation**\n  - [ ] Create path-specific context summaries\n  - [ ] Build context indexing system\n  - [ ] Create context-aware instruction files\n  - [ ] Implement lightweight context lookup\n\n- [ ] **Phase 3: Integration**\n  - [ ] Add instructions for agent world state awareness\n  - [ ] Create tools for context retrieval\n  - [ ] Document the system\n\n- [ ] **Phase 4: Testing & Documentation**\n  - [ ] Test context injection\n  - [ ] Document usage patterns\n  - [ ] Create examples\n\n### Options Being Considered\n\n1. **Path-specific instruction files** with historical summaries\n2. **Lightweight context index** for quick lookups\n3. **Thematic context bundles** by agent specialization\n4. **Dynamic context injection** based on file paths being worked on\n\n### Next Steps\nAnalyze the learnings structure more deeply and propose concrete implementations.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> Consider the learnings paths for example this learnings/discussions/discussion_issue_1492_20251117_032648.json and this learnings/discussions/knowledge_graph.json how does this play into our world state today? How could we incorporate it further i wanted to consider how i might build up further context for my custom agents on demand. Wondering if these files could help. Ideally when an agent gets work I want them to first look up and around at their world state. I am aware of the potential problems with filling the context window with too much and that causing rot or hallucinations. But i was thinking that we might somehow use this index of useful information. Perhaps we could do a copilot-instructions in specific sub areas of the code that makes them more aware of the history of that file paths. I am open to ideas here. Help me think through some options and present them to me.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n✨ Let Copilot coding agent [set things up for you](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/new?title=✨+Set+up+Copilot+instructions&body=Configure%20instructions%20for%20this%20repository%20as%20documented%20in%20%5BBest%20practices%20for%20Copilot%20coding%20agent%20in%20your%20repository%5D%28https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips%29%2E%0A%0A%3COnboard%20this%20repo%3E&assignees=copilot) — coding agent works faster and does higher quality work when set up for your repo.\n","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-17T03:42:09Z","mergedAt":null,"number":1497,"state":"OPEN","title":"[WIP] Explore knowledge graph for agent context","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/pull/1497"},{"author":{"is_bot":true,"login":"app/github-actions"},"body":"## 🧠 Enhanced Self-Documenting AI Learning\n\nThe @engineer-master agent has completed enhanced analysis of issue #1492.\n\n### What Was Learned\n\nThis PR contains learnings extracted using the **Enhanced Self-Documenting AI** system with:\n\n✨ **Advanced Pattern Recognition**\n- Detects complex discussion patterns\n- Identifies collaboration success stories\n- Recognizes decision-making processes\n\n🔗 **Knowledge Graph Connections**\n- Links related insights across discussions\n- Builds semantic connections\n- Enables discovery of related learnings\n\n📡 **Real-Time Learning**\n- Live analysis during active discussions\n- Proactive suggestions for documentation\n- Related past discussion recommendations\n\n🎯 **Proactive Suggestions**\n- Context-aware recommendations\n- Best practice reminders\n- Related insight discovery\n\n### Files Added\n\n- Discussion analysis (JSON)\n- Enhanced documentation (Markdown)\n- Knowledge graph connections\n- Enhancement metadata\n\n### Impact\n\nThe AI system becomes smarter with each discussion, continuously improving its ability to:\n- Understand technical concepts\n- Recognize effective collaboration\n- Suggest relevant insights\n- Connect related knowledge\n\n---\n\n*Following the @engineer-master systematic approach: rigorous analysis, defensive programming, and comprehensive validation.*\n\nCloses #1492","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-17T03:26:50Z","mergedAt":null,"number":1496,"state":"OPEN","title":"📚 Enhanced Learning: Issue #1492 (@engineer-master)","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/pull/1496"},{"author":{"is_bot":true,"login":"app/github-actions"},"body":"## 📺 New Chained TV Episode\n\nThis PR adds a new Chained TV episode generated from recent repository activity.\n\n### Changes\n- Updated `docs/episodes/latest.json`\n- Added timestamped episode file in `docs/episodes/`\n\n---\n*🤖 Automated episode generation workflow*","closedAt":null,"createdAt":"2025-11-17T03:08:06Z","mergedAt":null,"number":1495,"state":"OPEN","title":"📺 New Chained TV Episode -

Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n>   **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n>   \n>   #### 3. Missing Secrets\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n>   **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n>   \n>   #### 4. External Dependencies\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n>   **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n>   \n>   #### 5. Configuration Issues\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n>   **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n>   \n>   ### Recommended Actions\n>   1. **First:** Check if label-related (see Quick Fix above)\n>   2. Review the failed workflows breakdown above\n>   3. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs\n>   4. Focus on workflows with multiple failures first\n>   5.

Please produce a complete internal documentation page titled **“Data Storage & Lifecycle for Chained”** that covers:\n\n## 1. Data Storage Overview\n- Enumerate all storage locations in the repository and externally that hold data (e.g., folders like `learnings/`, `summaries/`, artifacts from workflows, external APIs, `.github/workflows/` outputs).\n- For each storage location, specify:\n  - Path (e.g., `/learnings/`, `/scripts/processed/`, GitHub Actions artifacts bucket, external database or API endpoint).\n  - Format of the stored data (e.g., JSON, CSV, Markdown logs, images, GitHub Pages HTML).\n  - Persistence vs ephemeral (for example: GitHub Actions artifacts may expire; docs under `docs/` are persistent; external API cache may be transient).\n\n## 2. Data Production Lifecycle in Chained\n- Identify and describe each data-production pathway in the repo:\n  - For example: cron workflows under `.github/workflows/idea-generator.yml` (pulling TLDR tech / Hacker News), agent-spawner workflows, tools like `tools/code-analyzer.py`, etc. (as referenced in README) 1\n- For each pathway include:\n  - Trigger: what initiates it (schedule, issue close, manual, external webhook).\n  - Input sources: e.g., tech news feeds, Hacker News, issues labels, agent performance metrics.\n  - Data transformation: what scripts/tools are used (for example `tools/pattern-matcher.py`, etc.).\n  - Output location and format: e.g., writes Markdown reports into `/summaries/`, updates `docs/`, or pushes to GitHub Pages.\n- Map them to the storage locations from section 1.\n\n## 3. Data Consumption Paths\n- Describe where and how stored data is consumed:\n  - In-repo logic: e.g., parts of the autonomous loop reference collected learnings, maybe the `learnings/` folder is used by agents.\n  - GitHub Pages: e.g., live dashboard at enufacas.github.io serves data from docs/ or from generated files. 2\n  - Visualizations/dashboards: e.g., world model map, agent leaderboard, timeline.\n  - Workflows that ingest or read stored data (for example when agents review prior learnings).\n- Link each consumption path back to its storage and production sources.\n\n## 4. End-to-End Data Flow Diagram\n- Create a high-level diagram (mermaid or PlantUML) showing:\n  - Data entering from external sources (TLDR Tech, Hacker News, issue discussions).\n  - Flow into production workflows (agent spawner, idea generator).\n  - Storage nodes (folders, artifacts, docs).\n  - Consumption nodes (dashboards, GitHub Pages, agent logic).\n- Annotate key nodes such as the loop: “Learn → Generate → Issue → Build → Merge → Learn”.\n\n## 5. Data Governance and Lifecycle Notes\n- Specify conventions the project uses (or should use) when adding new data sources, new folders or workflows.\n- Validation/verification steps: e.g., workflows under `.github/workflows` must be validated before being merged (as referenced in the README). 3\n- Artifact retention / cleanup policies: e.g., how long summaries stay, how to archive old learnings, how GitHub Pages builds refresh.\n- Risks or areas for improvement: e.g., if there are any undocumented storage locations or implicit paths, flag them and recommend logging/metadata.\n\n## 6. Format Expectations\n- Use clear headings and sub-headings.\n- Provide actual file paths and workflow names when possible (e.g., `.github/workflows/agent-spawner.yml`, `learnings/`, `docs/index.html`).\n- Do **not** assume undocumented paths—if something is unclear, note it as “to be defined” and recommend documenting it.\n- The documentation should be suitable for future contributors who want to understand **how Chained’s data flows from input → output → user facing dashboard**.\n\n---\n\n**Goal:** This document should act as the definitive “data architecture” reference for the Chained repository: where everything lives, how it’s created, how it’s used, and how everything links together.\n</issue_description>\n\n## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n\n<comments>\n</comments>\n\n\n</details>\n\n- Fixes enufacas/Chained#1454\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n✨ Let Copilot coding agent [set things up for you](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/new?title=✨+Set+up+Copilot+instructions&body=Configure%20instructions%20for%20this%20repository%20as%20documented%20in%20%5BBest%20practices%20for%20Copilot%20coding%20agent%20in%20your%20repository%5D%28https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips%29%2E%0A%0A%3COnboard%20this%20repo%3E&assignees=copilot) — coding agent works faster and does higher quality work when set up for your repo.\n","closedAt":"2025-11-17T01:14:15Z","createdAt":"2025-11-17T00:40:25Z","mergedAt":"2025-11-17T01:14:15Z","number":1455,"state":"MERGED","title":"docs: add comprehensive data storage & lifecycle architecture reference (@investigate-champion)","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/pull/1455"},{"author":{"is_bot":true,"login":"app/copilot-swe-agent"},"body":"Removes the interactive tutorial page and simplifies the GitHub Pages UI by collapsing all navigation into a hamburger menu across all pages.\n\n## Changes\n\n**Deleted**\n- `docs/interactive-tutorial.html` - removed entire interactive tutorial feature\n\n**index.html**\n- Removed hero section (tagline, CTA buttons)\n- Removed inline navigation links\n- Added hamburger menu visible on all screen sizes\n\n**Navigation standardization**\n- Added hamburger menu to: `agents.html`, `ai-friends.html`, `architecture-evolution.html`, `world-map.html`, `workflow-schedule.html`, `ai-knowledge-graph.html`, `lifecycle.html`\n- Unified navigation structure and link ordering across all pages\n\n**style.css**\n- Changed hamburger button to display on desktop (removed `@media (max-width: 768px)` constraint)\n- Made navigation menu a fixed right-side slide-out panel on all devices\n- Updated `.nav-menu.active` positioning for consistent slide-out behavior\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![Hamburger menu navigation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b00e9ba6-619b-46a8-a664-13e79cf2c282)\n\nNavigation now slides out from the right with full site navigation accessible from a single hamburger button on all pages and screen sizes.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Github pages ideas</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:communicator-maestro -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **📖 communicator-maestro** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@communicator-maestro** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/communicator-maestro.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/communicator-maestro.md).\n> > \n> > **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@communicator-maestro** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Remove this feature https://enufacas.github.io/Chained/interactive-tutorial.html\n> \n> Remove the header and collapse all navigation into the hamburger menu https://enufacas.github.io/Chained/index.html\n> \n> Ensure the same hamburger navigation is on all the github pages \n> </issue_description>\n> \n> ## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n> \n> <comments>\n> </comments>\n> \n\n\n</details>\n\n- Fixes enufacas/Chained#1452\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 We'd love your input!

Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n>   **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n>   \n>   #### 3. Missing Secrets\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n>   **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n>   \n>   #### 4. External Dependencies\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n>   **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n>   \n>   #### 5. Configuration Issues\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n>   **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n>   \n>   ### Recommended Actions\n>   1. **First:** Check if label-related (see Quick Fix above)\n>   2. Review the failed workflows breakdown above\n>   3. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs\n>   4. Focus on workflows with multiple failures first\n>   5. Verify secrets and permissions are configured correctly\n>   6.
