The agent-missions.yml workflow has a fallback to \"unknown\" when no agents score points\n2. There is no `.github/agents/unknown.md` file\n3. This creates an invalid mission that references a non-existent agent\n\n### Solution Plan\n- [ ] Create `.github/agents/unknown.md` as a fallback agent definition\n- [ ] Update the agent to have a proper profile that can handle any mission type\n- [ ] Configure it as a meta-coordinator style agent that can delegate to appropriate specialists\n- [ ] Test the solution by verifying the agent file works with assignment scripts\n\n### Next Steps\n1. Create the unknown agent definition file\n2. Implement it as a generalist/meta-coordinator agent\n3. Verify it resolves the issue\n4. Document the fallback behavior\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>🎯 Mission: AI/ML: Claude Innovation</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:unknown -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🤖 unknown** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@unknown** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/unknown.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/unknown.md).\n> > \n> > **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@unknown** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## 🎯 Agent Mission: AI/ML: Claude Innovation\n> \n> **Mission ID:** idea:18\n> **Created:** 2025-11-16 06:15:35 UTC\n> \n> ### 📋 Mission Summary\n> \n> Exploring claude trends with 18 mentions. davila7/claude-code-templates - CLI tool for configuring and monitoring Claude C...\n> \n> ### 🌍 Mission Locations\n> \n> US:San Francisco\n> \n> ### 🏷️ Patterns & Technologies\n> \n> claude, ai/ml\n> \n> ### 🤖 Assigned Agent\n> \n> **Unknown** (@unknown) - Match Score: 0.00\n> \n> This mission was matched to **@unknown** based on:\n> - Location relevance (30%)\n> - Role/skill match (40%)  \n> - Performance history (30%)\n> \n> ### 📊 Expected Outputs\n> \n> - [ ] Documentation related to claude, ai/ml\n> - [ ] Code examples or tools\n> - [ ] World model updates\n> - [ ] Learning artifacts\n> \n> ### 🔄 Next Steps\n> \n> 1. **@unknown** investigates the mission locations\n> 2.

Agent matching scores agents for a mission based on patterns, location, and performance\n2. If the best-scoring agent has an empty or missing 'specialization' field, it defaults to 'unknown' (line 116 in `tools/create_mission_issues.py`)\n3. This creates an issue with `@unknown` assignment, but no `.github/agents/unknown.md` file exists\n4. The assignment fails because the agent doesn't exist\n\n### Plan to Fix\n\n- [x] Analyze the repository structure and agent missions workflow\n- [x] Identify root cause in `tools/create_mission_issues.py`\n- [ ] Add validation in agent selection to ensure valid agents are always selected\n- [ ] Add a fallback mechanism to select a default valid agent when scoring fails\n- [ ] Create defensive checks in `create_mission_issues.py` to prevent unknown agent assignments\n- [ ] Test the fix to ensure proper agent assignment\n- [ ] Update documentation if needed\n\n### Files to Modify\n1. `.github/workflows/agent-missions.yml` - Add validation after agent scoring\n2. `tools/create_mission_issues.py` - Add defensive checks and fallback logic\n3. Possibly add a safety check in `tools/assign-agent-directly.sh`\n\n### Current Issue Solution\nFor this specific issue (#current), I'll need to:\n1. Fix the agent assignment code to prevent \"unknown\" agents\n2. Manually reassign this issue to a valid agent (investigate-champion or engineer-master)\n3. Update the issue with proper agent directives\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>🎯 Mission: AI/ML: Agents Innovation</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:unknown -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🤖 unknown** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@unknown** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/unknown.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/unknown.md).\n> > \n> > **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@unknown** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## 🎯 Agent Mission: AI/ML: Agents Innovation\n> \n> **Mission ID:** idea:17\n> **Created:** 2025-11-16 06:15:34 UTC\n> \n> ### 📋 Mission Summary\n> \n> Exploring agents trends with 38 mentions.

Pattern recognition engine analyzing historical executions to predict optimal scheduling times with confidence scores\n- **`tools/integrated_workflow_orchestrator.py`** (333 lines) - Integration layer combining AI predictions with existing orchestrator tools\n- **`tools/test_ai_workflow_predictor.py`** (322 lines) - Test suite covering prediction accuracy, conflict detection, resource classification\n\n## Key Capabilities\n\n**Pattern Learning**: Analyzes success rates by hour, identifies high-performing time windows, tracks duration trends\n\n**Conflict Detection**: Identifies workflows that frequently run concurrently, staggers schedules to prevent resource contention\n\n**Resource Classification**: Categorizes workflows as low/medium/high impact based on duration, prefers off-peak hours for heavy workloads\n\n**Confidence Scoring**: Each prediction includes 0-100% confidence based on historical data depth and consistency\n\n## Usage\n\n```python\nfrom tools.ai_workflow_predictor import AIWorkflowPredictor\n\npredictor = AIWorkflowPredictor()\n\n# Record execution\npredictor.record_execution(\n    workflow_name=\"deploy\",\n    start_time=datetime.now(timezone.utc),\n    duration_seconds=245,\n    success=True,\n    resource_usage={'cpu_percent': 45, 'memory_mb': 512}\n)\n\n# Get prediction\nprediction = predictor.predict_optimal_time(\"deploy\")\n# => PredictionResult(recommended_time=\"0 3 * * *\", confidence=0.85, expected_duration=245)\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\nPure Python ML using statistical pattern analysis - no scipy/sklearn dependencies. History stored in `.github/workflow-history/executions.json` (last 1000 runs). Dry-run mode available for testing recommendations before applying.\n\nDemo workflow at `.github/workflows/ai-workflow-orchestrator-demo.yml` with report/simulate/export modes.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>🤖 AI Idea: Create an AI-powered workflow orchestrator that predicts optimal execution times</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:coordinate-wizard -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🎹 coordinate-wizard** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@coordinate-wizard** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/coordinate-wizard.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/coordinate-wizard.md).\n> > \n> > **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@coordinate-wizard** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## 🤖 AI & Autonomy Idea\n> \n> **Idea:** Create an AI-powered workflow orchestrator that predicts optimal execution times\n> \n> **Generated:** 2025-11-16 04:32:29 UTC\n> **Category:** AI & Autonomy\n> **Focus:** auto\n> **ID:** ai-idea-1763267549\n> \n> ### 🎯 Why This Matters\n> \n> This idea focuses on enhancing the autonomous capabilities of the Chained system.

Map library CDNs were blocked, causing blank screens. Code checked `worldState.regions` without verifying `worldState.agents` existed first, causing crashes.\n\n## Changes\n\n### Core Fixes\n- Fixed null reference bug: added `worldState.agents &&` check before array access\n- Added CDN fallback chain: unpkg.com → cdnjs.cloudflare.com → graceful degradation\n- Added SRI integrity hashes for security\n- Implemented fallback UI when Leaflet unavailable (sidebar continues showing all data)\n\n### Agent Visualization\n- Draw movement paths using `L.polyline()` with color-coded performance:\n  - Green (≥85%), Blue (≥50%), Orange (≥30%), Red (<30%)\n- Add waypoint markers (`L.circleMarker`) at each stop\n- Display journey progress, missions, and metrics in popups\n\n### Region & Context\n- Render regions as `L.circle()` sized by idea count: `radius = ideaCount × 5000`\n- Show agent count per region\n- Label significant locations (>5 ideas or home base)\n\n### Data Integration  \n- Use `world_state.json` as source of truth for locations\n- Three-tier priority: `location_region_id` → defaults → fallback\n- Display data freshness timestamp with color-coded status\n- Add loading states: ⏳ Loading... → ✅/⚠️\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\n// Agent path with color based on performance\nconst pathColor = score >= 0.85 ? '#10b981' : \n                  score >= 0.5  ? '#0891b2' : \n                  score >= 0.3  ? '#f59e0b' : '#ef4444';\n\nL.polyline(coordinates, {\n  color: pathColor,\n  weight: 2,\n  opacity: 0.6,\n  dashArray: '5, 10'\n}).addTo(pathLayers);\n\n// Region circle sized by ideas\nL.circle([region.lat, region.lng], {\n  radius: Math.max(5000, Math.min(50000, ideaCount * 5000)),\n  fillOpacity: 0.15\n}).addTo(regionLayers);\n```\n\n## Screenshots\n\n**Before** - Blank screen with no feedback:\n![Before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/218b8e28-3972-4d42-9eeb-e340b632060c)\n\n**After** - Fallback UI with full data access when Leaflet blocked:\n![After](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64c437da-658e-43af-8420-5d5afec7863c)\n\nWhen Leaflet loads properly, users see interactive map with agent markers, dashed path polylines, and region circles.\n\n## Documentation\nAdded `WORLD_MAP_README.md` (280 lines) covering data sources, Leaflet implementation, workflow integration, and troubleshooting.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> <details>\n> <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses (expand for details)</summary>\n>\n> #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules:\n>\n> - `cdn.jsdelivr.net`\n>   - Triggering command: `curl -sL REDACTED -o leaflet.css` (dns block)\n> - `unpkg.com`\n>   - Triggering command: `wget -q REDACTED -O leaflet.css` (dns block)\n>   - Triggering command: `wget -q REDACTED -O MarkerCluster.css` (dns block)\n>\n> If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either:\n>\n> - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled\n> - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to the custom allowlist in this repository's [Copilot coding agent settings](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/settings/copilot/coding_agent) (admins only)\n>\n> </details>\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> https://enufacas.github.io/Chained/world-map.html the map is not really representing the movement or location or accurate world state.

Missions were created but agents weren't assigned correctly, preventing work from starting.\n\n## Root Causes\n\nThree distinct issues:\n\n1. **Wrong agent info**: Script called `match-issue-to-agent.py \"agent-mission\"` → returned `meta-coordinator` instead of specified agent\n2. **Premature labeling**: `copilot-assigned` label added before GraphQL assignment → issues marked as assigned when they weren't\n3. **Missing pipeline stage**: Assignment not integrated into autonomous pipeline → 0-15 minute delay\n\n## Changes\n\n### Fix #1: Agent Info Retrieval\n`tools/assign-agent-directly.sh` line 34:\n\n```bash\n# Before: Generic match returns wrong agent\nagent_info=$(python3 tools/match-issue-to-agent.py \"agent-mission\" \"\" ...)\n\n# After: Direct lookup gets specified agent\nagent_info=$(python3 tools/get-agent-info.py info \"$matched_agent\" ...)\n```\n\n### Fix #2: Label Timing\n`tools/assign-agent-directly.sh`:\n\n```bash\n# Before: Label added at line 91, before assignment attempt\ngh issue edit --add-label \"copilot-assigned\"\n# ... GraphQL assignment might fail, but label stays\n\n# After: Label added at line 220, only after success check\nif successful_graphql_assignment; then\n  gh issue edit --add-label \"copilot-assigned\"\nfi\n```\n\n### Fix #3: Pipeline Integration\n`.github/workflows/autonomous-pipeline.yml`:\n\nAdded **Stage 4.75: Assign Agents to Missions** between Stage 4.5 (merge mission PR) and Stage 5 (self-reinforcement):\n\n```yaml\nassign-agents-to-missions:\n  needs: [agent-missions, merge-mission-pr]\n  if: needs.agent-missions.outputs.mission_count > 0 && inputs.skip_assignment != true\n  steps:\n    - run: |\n        jq -r '.[] | \"\\(.issue_number) \\(.agent_specialization)\"' created_missions.json | \\\n        while read -r issue_number agent_specialization; do\n          ./tools/assign-agent-directly.sh \"$issue_number\" \"$agent_specialization\"\n        done\n```\n\nAdded `skip_assignment` workflow input for manual control.\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Performance**: ~15 minutes faster (immediate vs waiting for scheduled workflow)\n- **Correctness**: Proper agent info, accurate label state\n- **Reliability**: Failed assignments don't block pipeline, scheduled workflow provides retry\n- **Backward compatible**: Existing workflows continue to work\n\n## Test Coverage\n\n- `tests/test_assign_agent_directly_fix.py` - Verifies correct agent retrieval\n- `tests/test_copilot_label_timing.py` - Verifies label ordering\n- Integration test validates end-to-end flow\n\nAll tests passing.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> The direct assignment of agents to missions is not working.
