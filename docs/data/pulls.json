Investigation confirms scoring formulas are mathematically correct; the issue is 0% of agents have PRs recorded.\n\n## Root Cause\n\n**PR attribution broken**: `issue_history.json` shows `pr_number: null` for all resolved issues.\n\n**Impact**: 50% of weighted score inaccurate\n- `code_quality` (30%): defaults to 0.5 for 96% of agents\n- `pr_success` (20%): always 0.0\n- Result: artificial convergence at 0.43 (agents with issues) and 0.23 (agents without)\n\n```python\n# Example: Agent with 1 issue resolved\ncode_quality:      0.50 × 30% = 0.150  # DEFAULTED (should vary 0.0-1.0)\nissue_resolution:  1.00 × 20% = 0.200  # Correct\npr_success:        0.00 × 20% = 0.000  # WRONG (PR data missing)\npeer_review:       0.00 × 15% = 0.000  # Correct\ncreativity:        0.53 × 15% = 0.080  # Correct\n                              ───────\n                         Total = 0.430  # Converged score\n```\n\n## Solution Implemented\n\n**@assert-specialist** has implemented a multi-layered fix for PR attribution:\n\n### 1. Git-Based Fallback (`tools/agent-metrics-collector.py`)\n- **New method**: `_find_prs_via_git()` automatically activates when GitHub API returns 0 PRs\n- **How it works**: Parses git log for merge commits, extracts PR numbers, matches issue references\n- **Benefits**: Works without GitHub API, handles rate limits gracefully\n- **Lines**: +94 modifications\n\n### 2. Repair Tool (`tools/fix_pr_attribution.py`)\n- **Purpose**: One-time fix for existing `issue_history.json` (8 records with `pr_number: null`)\n- **Features**: \n  - Scans entire git history for PR → Issue mappings\n  - Creates backup before making changes\n  - Supports `--dry-run` for safe preview\n- **Lines**: 187 new lines\n\n### 3. Test Suite\n- **`test_git_pr_fallback.py`**: Validates git-based fallback logic (140 lines)\n- **`test_agent_scoring_accuracy.py`**: 6 comprehensive tests analyzing 25 agents\n  - Score calculation accuracy ✅\n  - Score diversity analysis ❌ (64% convergence detected)\n  - Code quality defaults ❌ (96% using default)\n  - PR attribution logic ❌ (0% PRs found)\n  - Activity correlation ✅\n  - Creativity diversity ❌ (64% identical)\n- **`test_pr_attribution_debug.py`**: Debug tool for investigating specific agents\n\n### 4.

Enforces 10-agent capacity limit and label creation before use.\n\n## Core Implementation\n\n### Agent Mission Workflow (`.github/workflows/agent-missions.yml`)\n- Triggered by world model updates\n- Scores all agents by location (30%), role (40%), performance (30%)\n- Enforces 10-agent capacity: `top_agents = agent_scores[:10]`\n- Creates GitHub issues with proper labels (creates missing labels via API)\n- Moves agents to mission locations in `world_state.json`\n\n### Self-Reinforcement Workflow (`.github/workflows/self-reinforcement.yml`)\n- Collects closed issues and merged PRs from last 7 days\n- Generates `UNSUPERVISED_LEARNING_COMPLETE_*.md`\n- Triggers `combined-learning.yml` to close the loop\n\n### Mission Issue Creation (`tools/create_mission_issues.py`)\n```python\n# Ensure labels exist before use\nexisting_labels = {label['name'] for label in repo.get_labels()}\nfor label_name in required_labels:\n    if label_name not in existing_labels:\n        repo.create_label(name=label_name, color=\"0E8A16\")\n\n# Create issue with proper format\nissue = repo.create_issue(\n    title=f\"[MISSION] {mission_id}\",\n    body=mission_body,\n    labels=required_labels,\n    assignees=[agent['id'] for agent in top_agents[:10]]  # MAX 10\n)\n```\n\n## Workflow Chain\n```\nTLDR/HN → combined-learning → world-update → agent-missions → self-reinforcement → [loop]\n```\n\nTriggers added:\n- `combined-learning.yml` → dispatches `world-update.yml`\n- `world-update.yml` → dispatches `agent-missions.yml`\n- `self-reinforcement.yml` → dispatches `combined-learning.yml`\n\n## Documentation\n- `docs/AUTONOMOUS_SYSTEM.md` - Architecture and components\n- `docs/SYSTEM_FLOW_GUIDE.md` - Visual flow diagrams and enforcement rules\n- `docs/WORKING_WITH_SYSTEM.md` - User guide and monitoring commands\n- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Verification and completion status\n\n## The 8 Questions Answered\n1. Learning artifacts → `learnings/` directory\n2. World model updates → `world-update.yml` modifies JSON files\n3. Agents reacting → Selected by scoring algorithm\n4. 10-agent limit → `[:10]` slice enforced in code\n5. Agent movement → `location_region_id` updated in world state\n6. Mission issues → Created via `create_mission_issues.py`\n7. Labels created → API calls before issue creation\n8. Loop continuation → `self-reinforcement.yml` triggers `combined-learning.yml`\n\nSystem operates continuously on 8 AM/8 PM UTC learning schedule plus daily midnight self-reinforcement.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\nYou are the SYSTEM ARCHITECT and IMPLEMENTER inside the GitHub repository “Chained.”\n\nYour job is to evolve this repository toward an end state where the:\n1.

Documentation phase complete, implementation phase handed over to @create-guru\n\n## Phase 1: Documentation (Complete by @support-master) ✅\n\n**AUTONOMOUS_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md** (22KB)\n- Visual flow diagram of 5-stage autonomous loop\n- Core component interactions (Learning, World Model, Agents, Workflows, Self-Reinforcement)\n- Critical constraints with enforcement patterns\n- Workflow orchestration using `workflow_run` triggers to prevent race conditions\n- 8 mandatory completion questions framework\n\n**AUTONOMOUS_LOOP_IMPLEMENTATION.md** (32KB)\n- Copy-paste workflow templates for each stage\n- Label creation patterns (create before use)\n- Agent capacity validation integration\n- Workflow chaining examples preventing file conflicts\n- Integration test procedures\n\n**COMPLETION_QUESTIONS.md** (14KB)\n- Audit framework: 8 questions every workflow must answer\n- Valid/invalid response examples\n- Automated validation script\n- PR/issue body templates\n\n## Validation Tools\n\n**tools/validate_agent_capacity.py**\n```bash\n$ python3 tools/validate_agent_capacity.py @agent-1 @agent-2 @agent-3\n✅ WITHIN CAPACITY: 3/10 agents assigned\n\n$ python3 tools/validate_agent_capacity.py @agent-{1..12}\n❌ CAPACITY VIOLATION: 12 agents exceeds limit of 10\n💡 Suggestion: Create backlog issue with label 'future-expansion'\n```\n\n**tools/create_labels.py**\n```bash\n$ python3 tools/create_labels.py --system --agents\n# Bulk creates standardized labels before workflow use\n```\n\n## Phase 2: Implementation (Handed to @create-guru) 🚧\n\nBased on feedback that this requires refactoring and architectural implementation (not just documentation), the implementation phase has been handed over to **@create-guru** who specializes in infrastructure creation and workflow systems.\n\n**HANDOVER_TO_CREATE_GURU.md** - Complete transition plan created with:\n- Implementation checklist for 50+ workflows\n- Refactoring scope and timeline (6-9 business days)\n- Constraint enforcement integration points\n- Success criteria and validation procedures\n\n**Implementation Scope:**\n- Refactor existing workflows to enforce PR-based pattern (no direct push to main)\n- Integrate validation hooks (agent capacity, label creation)\n- Build workflow orchestration with `workflow_run` chaining\n- Implement automated constraint enforcement\n\n**Target Outcomes:**\n- ✅ 100% PR-based workflows (no direct push to main)\n- ✅ 10-agent capacity validation before every assignment\n- ✅ Labels created before use in all workflows\n- ✅ Robust workflow orchestration with `workflow_run` chaining\n- ✅ Consistent @agent-name attribution\n- ✅ >50% reduction in workflow duplication\n- ✅ Fully operational autonomous loop\n\n## Integration\n\nUpdated README with prominent \"Autonomous System Documentation\" section linking all guides. Documentation by **@support-master** serves as the specification that **@create-guru** will follow for implementation. All templates enforce branch protection (PR-only, never push to main), proper @agent-name attribution, and completion question requirements.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**@create-guru** will begin implementation phase:\n1. Audit all workflows for constraint violations\n2. Refactor workflows to enforce branch protection\n3. Integrate validation tools into workflow steps\n4. Implement workflow orchestration with chaining\n5. Test and validate autonomous loop operation\n\n- Fixes enufacas/Chained#1042\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n\n----\n\n*This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n\n<issue_title>Chained System Architect Prompt: Unified Autonomous Loop & Critical Constraints</issue_title>\n<issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:support-master -->\n\n> **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> \n> This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **📖 support-master** custom agent profile.\n> \n> **@support-master** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/support-master.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/support-master.md).\n> \n> **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@support-master** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n\n---\n\n# SYSTEM ARCHITECT & IMPLEMENTER BLUEPRINT for \"Chained\"\n\n## 🔥 Mission\nEvolve the [enufacas/Chained](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained) repository toward a seamless, closed-loop autonomous system, integrating:\n\n1. **LEARNING SYSTEM** (ingest TLDR, HN, Trending)\n2. **WORLD MODEL** (knowledge graph: world_state.json, knowledge.json)\n3. **AGENT SYSTEM** (`.github/agents/`, specialization, metrics)\n4. **WORKFLOWS** (GitHub Actions: orchestration)\n5. **MISSION/ISSUE CREATION**\n\nAll components must operate as a self-improving, closed-loop system with minimal human intervention.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 Critical Constraints (Absolute Rules)\n\n### 1. **Branch Protection**\n- All changes through Pull Requests. **Never** push directly to main from any workflow.\n\n### 2. **Label Management**\n- **Never** assume labels exist. Create (or update) before applying in every issue-creating workflow.\n- Use lowercase and hyphenated names: `learning-assignment`, `agent-mission`, `location-san-francisco`.\n\n### 3. **Agent Capacity Limit**\n- **No more than 10 agents** on any mission.\n- Enforce with hard validation. Overflow: move extras to a backlog issue (label: `future-expansion`).\n- Use agent, location, skill, and past mission relevance for selection.\n\n### 4. **@agent-name Mentions**\n- Use `@agent-name` everywhere agents are referenced for clarity and accountability.\n\n### 5. **Issue/PR Updates**\n- Always post a status/progress comment before marking a mission complete or removing WIP status.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Autonomous Loop Workflow\n\n### 1. **Learning Ingestion**\n- Workflows: `learn-from-tldr.yml`, `learn-from-hackernews.yml`\n- Output: Normalized JSON in `learnings/`\n- Trigger: Combined learning workflow\n\n### 2. **Combined Learning Generation**\n- Workflow: `combined-learning.yml`\n- Output: Analysis & summary in `learnings/`, Issue/PR for context\n- Trigger: World model update\n\n### 3. **World Model Update**\n- Workflow: `world-update.yml`\n- Syncs agents & learnings to world state, updates `knowledge.json`, PR to main\n- Trigger: Agent assignment\n\n### 4. **Agent Movement & Mission Creation**\n- Workflow: `assign-agents-to-learnings.yml` (or future `agent-missions.yml`)\n- 10-agent limit enforced; creates issues for assignments; (ensure PR always, never direct push)\n- Use collaboration/investment/navigator modules\n\n### 5. **Self-Reinforcement & Loop Closure**\n- Workflows: `collect-resolved-issues.yml`, `pr-failure-learning.yml`\n- On PR/issue closure, extract learning, add to feedback docs/analysis, restart ingestion\n\n### Chaining: Use `workflow_run` triggers to enforce proper sequential execution between stages (prevents race conditions and file conflicts).\n\n---\n\n## 8 Mandatory Completion Questions\n1. Where is the learning artifact? (`learnings/`, `analysis/`, or `investigation-reports/`)\n2. Where is the world model update? (`world/` JSONs updated via sync modules)\n3. Which agents are reacting? (@agent-name links, assignment files)\n4. Are no more than 10 agents assigned? (validated in assignment workflow)\n5. How do agents move in the world model? (`agent_navigator.py` logs, `world_state.json`)\n6. What mission issue is being created? (URL, title, labels)\n7. Were all labels created before use? (Check logs & workflow outputs)\n8. Which workflow continues the loop? (workflow_run and PR triggers)\n\n**Work is incomplete if any answer is missing.

This caused issues created by `goal-progress-checker.yml` and `world-update.yml` to only be caught by the 15-minute scheduled fallback, resulting in delayed Copilot assignment.\n\n## Changes\n\n**Workflow Trigger Enhancement** (`.github/workflows/copilot-graphql-assign.yml`)\n- Added `workflow_run` trigger for \"Idea Generation: Progress Checker\" and \"World Model Update\"\n- Triggers on workflow completion (success only)\n- Reduces assignment latency from 15 minutes to ~1-2 minutes for automated workflow-created issues\n\n```yaml\nworkflow_run:\n  workflows:\n    - \"Idea Generation: Progress Checker\"\n    - \"World Model Update\"\n  types:\n    - completed\n```\n\n**Job Condition Update**\n- Extended condition to handle `workflow_run` events with success check\n- Maintains backward compatibility with existing triggers\n\n```yaml\nif: |\n  github.event_name == 'issues' ||\n  github.event_name == 'schedule' ||\n  github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' ||\n  (github.event_name == 'workflow_run' && github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success')\n```\n\n**Concurrency Control**\n- Updated group to include `workflow_run.id` to prevent race conditions between trigger types\n\n**Documentation** (`FAQ.md`)\n- Added section explaining the three-tier trigger system (direct, workflow_run, scheduled)\n- Documents timing expectations and fallback behavior\n\n## Result\n\nThree-tier trigger system ensures comprehensive coverage:\n1. Direct event: &lt;1 min (manual/PAT-created issues)\n2. Workflow run: 1-2 min (automated workflow-created issues) ← **new**\n3. Scheduled: max 15 min (safety net)\n\nThe existing assignment script already handles non-`issues` events by processing all open issues, making this a trigger-only change with no script modifications needed.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Copilot assingment </issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:create-guru -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🏭 create-guru** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@create-guru** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/create-guru.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/create-guru.md).\n> > \n> > **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@create-guru** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Copilot assignment workfkow not handling issues created by goal-progress-checker.yml and world-update.yml\n> </issue_description>\n> \n> ## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n> \n> <comments>\n> </comments>\n> \n\n\n</details>\n\n- Fixes enufacas/Chained#1018\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n✨ Let Copilot coding agent [set things up for you](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/new?title=✨+Set+up+Copilot+instructions&body=Configure%20instructions%20for%20this%20repository%20as%20documented%20in%20%5BBest%20practices%20for%20Copilot%20coding%20agent%20in%20your%20repository%5D%28https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips%29%2E%0A%0A%3COnboard%20this%20repo%3E&assignees=copilot) — coding agent works faster and does higher quality work when set up for your repo.\n","closedAt":"2025-11-15T15:30:55Z","createdAt":"2025-11-15T15:18:52Z","mergedAt":"2025-11-15T15:30:55Z","number":1019,"state":"MERGED","title":"Add workflow_run trigger to handle issues created by automated workflows (@create-guru)","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/pull/1019"},{"author":{"is_bot":true,"login":"app/github-actions"},"body":"## Automated Timeline Data Update\n  \n  **Date:** 2025-11-15 15:12:40 UTC\n  \n  ### Summary\n  This PR updates the timeline data with the latest repository activity metrics.\n  \n  ### Changes\n  - Updated issues and pull request data\n  - Refreshed workflow run statistics\n  - Updated automation metrics and completion rates\n  - Regenerated activity summary\n  \n  ### Data Updated\n  - `docs/data/issues.json` - Recent issues\n  - `docs/data/pulls.json` - Recent pull requests\n  - `docs/data/workflows.json` - Workflow runs\n  - `docs/data/stats.json` - Repository statistics\n  - `docs/data/automation-log.json` - Automation activity\n  \n  ---\n  *This PR was automatically created by the System Monitor workflow and will be auto-merged.*","closedAt":"2025-11-15T15:14:09Z","createdAt":"2025-11-15T15:12:42Z","mergedAt":"2025-11-15T15:14:08Z","number":1017,"state":"MERGED","title":"📊 Timeline Update - 2025-11-15 15:12:40 UTC","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/pull/1017"},{"author":{"is_bot":true,"login":"app/copilot-swe-agent"},"body":"The `assign-agents-to-learnings.yml` workflow was failing due to incorrect indentation in shell scripts within YAML `run: |` blocks.

Given their specialty I want to match them to a historical learning and have them generate an idea around it. I would expect that this learnings discovered location then influences their location on the map. \n> \n> I also want to make a directive that once an agent gets attached to a learning they have some investment in that general category or idea. So they may choose to further cultivate it. If there are opportunities to cross collaborate they might ask other agents with a specialty thay could help them to weigh in. We also need some guiding post here that the features we implement should have a presentation layer out to github pages. Rather it be explicitly through a visual like the entire mapping feature or through a demonstration page. It is vitally important that the world model and world map are a central jumping off point to understand agent activity. The agents should read from that state to reconcile part of their truth. If we need to break out that file so we avoid merge conflicts as multiple workflowd could be running that want to update meta data that is alright.

Forces browsers to treat this as a new file\n   - Bypasses browser cache\n   - Bypasses CDN cache\n\n2. **Cache-control meta tags**: \n   - `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`\n   - `Pragma: no-cache`\n   - `Expires: 0`\n   - Prevents future caching issues\n\n### Changes Made\n- [x] Added cache-control meta tags to `<head>` section\n- [x] Added version parameter `?v=2.0.1731903372` to script src\n- [x] Added descriptive comment explaining cache-busting\n- [x] Tested locally to verify correct file is loaded\n\n### Verification\n✅ Local testing confirms the NEW Leaflet implementation loads:\n- Script loads from `world-map.js?v=2.0.1731903372` \n- Code attempts to initialize Leaflet (line 90: `initMap()`)\n- ReferenceError for `L` confirms it's the Leaflet code, not SVG code\n\n### Screenshot\n![World Map Page Structure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1aea1de-a1c7-4d64-8db7-38d34e51471b)\n*Page structure showing the Leaflet-based layout (CDN blocked in test environment)*\n\n### Expected Outcome\nOnce deployed to GitHub Pages:\n- ✅ New Leaflet-based interactive map with OpenStreetMap tiles\n- ✅ All 43 agents visible with color-coded markers\n- ✅ Full pan/zoom capability\n- ✅ Mobile-responsive touch controls\n- ✅ Professional marker clustering\n- ✅ No more SVG-based static map\n\n### Technical Details\n```diff\n+ <meta http-equiv=\"Cache-Control\" content=\"no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate\">\n+ <meta http-equiv=\"Pragma\" content=\"no-cache\">\n+ <meta http-equiv=\"Expires\" content=\"0\">\n\n- <script src=\"world-map.js\"></script>\n+ <script src=\"world-map.js?v=2.0.1731903372\"></script>\n```\n\nThe version number `2.0.1731903372` combines:\n- Major version: `2.0` (Leaflet implementation)\n- Timestamp: `1731903372` (Unix timestamp for cache busting)\n\n---\n\n*Fix implemented to resolve cache issue preventing new map implementation from loading on live site.*\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> Why does this show the old map implementation https://enufacas.github.io/Chained/world-map.html\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 We'd love your input!

appears near the clicked element instead of far to the left\n- [x] Tooltip text formatting fixed - properly displays multi-line content with correct spacing\n- [x] All region selections work correctly (regions on map are clickable)\n\n### 🎨 Changes Made\n\n1. **Complete Geographic Redesign**\n   - Replaced simplified abstract shapes with accurate, recognizable continent outlines\n   - Added 14 distinct geographic features:\n     - **Major continents**: North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, Antarctica\n     - **Islands and landmasses**: Greenland, Iceland, Japan, Southeast Asia/Indonesia, New Zealand (North & South), UK/Ireland, Madagascar\n   - Professional cartographic appearance with realistic proportions\n\n2. **Enhanced Visual Presentation**\n   - Ocean background (#1a2838) provides excellent contrast with landmasses\n   - Latitude/longitude grid lines for geographic reference and spatial orientation\n   - Continent styling with shadows and proper opacity for depth\n   - Landmass color (#34495e) clearly distinguishes from ocean\n\n3. **Fixed Tooltip Positioning**\n   - Tooltip now positions dynamically near clicked element\n   - Stays within SVG bounds (adjusts if too close to edges)\n   - Shows above marker by default, below if no room above\n   - Pointer triangle now correctly points to the clicked item\n\n4. **Fixed Tooltip Text Formatting**\n   - Changed from innerHTML to programmatically created tspan elements\n   - Each line of text now displays on its own line\n   - Proper spacing between lines\n   - Dynamic height based on content\n   - Color-coded score display (green/cyan/amber/red based on performance)\n\n### 📸 Screenshots\n\n**Before (Original):**\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/561a2426-572d-40bf-96e2-787d371b36a0\">\n\n**After (Realistic Geography):**\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e978f78e-4cef-4661-8edf-8e078c3e096a\">\n\n**Tooltip Working Correctly:**\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27387aef-7b6e-477f-b8bc-f9debbaac14c\">\n\n### 🧪 Testing Performed\n- ✅ Map loads with realistic, recognizable continent shapes\n- ✅ All major continents clearly visible (North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, Antarctica)\n- ✅ Ocean background provides excellent contrast\n- ✅ Grid lines help with spatial orientation\n- ✅ Agent markers display correctly on landmasses\n- ✅ Clicking agents shows properly formatted tooltip with all information\n- ✅ Tooltip positions near clicked agent\n- ✅ Close button works to dismiss tooltip\n- ✅ Multiple agents can be clicked sequentially\n- ✅ Region circles are clickable and show region information\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@create-guru** by name in all related conversations.\n\n---\n\nFixes enufacas/Chained#952\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>World map </issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:create-guru -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **null create-guru** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@create-guru** -

Config Updates (`.github/agent-system/config.json`)\n- **Promotion threshold**: 85% → 65% (agents can now actually reach promotion)\n- **Grace period**: 48 hours for new agents to establish themselves\n- **Minimum score**: 40% guaranteed during grace period\n- **Strict PR attribution**: Enabled to ensure proper credit\n\n### 2. Evaluator Improvements (`.github/workflows/agent-evaluator.yml`)\n- Added grace period logic to protect new agents\n- Minimum score boost applied during grace period\n- Agent registry now syncs to GitHub Pages automatically\n- Creates PR instead of direct push (respects branch protection)\n\n### 3. GitHub Pages Sync\n- Registry now available at `docs/data/agents/agent-registry.json`\n- Ensures agent data is accessible for visualization\n- Verified healthy with 11 agents currently tracked\n\n### 4. Comprehensive Test Suite\n- `test_agent_progression_improvements.py` - Core progression improvements (6/6 passing ✅)\n- `test_pr_attribution.py` - PR attribution system (4/4 passing ✅)\n- `test_scoring_system.py` - Scoring calculations (6/6 passing ✅)\n- `test_end_to_end_agent_system.py` - Full system integration (7/7 passing ✅)\n\n## Impact Analysis\n\n**Before @accelerate-master's fixes:**\n- Average agent score: 15.75%\n- Highest agent score: 43.32%\n- Agents eligible for promotion (≥85%): 0/11\n- Progression gap: 55% (very difficult)\n- No grace period for new agents\n- No minimum score guarantee\n\n**After @accelerate-master's optimizations:**\n- Promotion threshold: 65% (achievable) ✅\n- Progression gap: 35% (much more reasonable) ✅\n- New agents protected for 48 hours ✅\n- Minimum score: 40% during grace period ✅\n- Example good agent (68.5% score) would be promoted ✅\n- PR attribution system verified working ✅\n- GitHub Pages healthy and synced ✅\n\n## Performance Metrics\n\nThe improvements make agent progression **36% faster** by reducing the gap agents must cross from 55% to 35%. Combined with the 48-hour grace period and 40% minimum score guarantee, new agents have a fair chance to prove themselves before facing elimination.\n\n## Test Results Summary\n\nAll test suites passing with 100% success rate:\n\n```\n✅ test_agent_progression_improvements.py: 6/6 tests passing\n✅ test_pr_attribution.py: 4/4 tests passing  \n✅ test_scoring_system.py: 6/6 tests passing\n✅ test_end_to_end_agent_system.py: 7/7 tests passing\n```\n\n**Total: 23/23 tests passing** 🎉\n\n## Verification Complete\n\n**@accelerate-master** has verified end-to-end system health:\n\n✓ Configuration thresholds optimized (65% promotion, 30% elimination)  \n✓ Grace period active (48 hours, 40% minimum score)  \n✓ PR attribution system working correctly  \n✓ GitHub Pages sync operational (11 agents tracked)  \n✓ Scoring weights properly configured (sum to 100%)  \n✓ Agent progression achievable with realistic scores  \n✓ All system components present and functional  \n✓ Branch protection respected (workflow creates PRs)\n\n**System Status: HEALTHY** ✨\n\n**@accelerate-master** has optimized the system for better agent throughput and progression velocity.\n\n- Fixes enufacas/Chained#950\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Agent stuff and fixes</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:accelerate-master -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **📈 accelerate-master** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@accelerate-master** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/accelerate-master.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/accelerate-master.md).\n> > \n> > **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@accelerate-master** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> There is a problem with the Agent scoring.
