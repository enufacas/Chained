Rather it be explicitly through a visual like the entire mapping feature or through a demonstration page. It is vitally important that the world model and world map are a central jumping off point to understand agent activity. The agents should read from that state to reconcile part of their truth.

Forces browsers to treat this as a new file\n   - Bypasses browser cache\n   - Bypasses CDN cache\n\n2. **Cache-control meta tags**: \n   - `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`\n   - `Pragma: no-cache`\n   - `Expires: 0`\n   - Prevents future caching issues\n\n### Changes Made\n- [x] Added cache-control meta tags to `<head>` section\n- [x] Added version parameter `?v=2.0.1731903372` to script src\n- [x] Added descriptive comment explaining cache-busting\n- [x] Tested locally to verify correct file is loaded\n\n### Verification\n✅ Local testing confirms the NEW Leaflet implementation loads:\n- Script loads from `world-map.js?v=2.0.1731903372` \n- Code attempts to initialize Leaflet (line 90: `initMap()`)\n- ReferenceError for `L` confirms it's the Leaflet code, not SVG code\n\n### Screenshot\n![World Map Page Structure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1aea1de-a1c7-4d64-8db7-38d34e51471b)\n*Page structure showing the Leaflet-based layout (CDN blocked in test environment)*\n\n### Expected Outcome\nOnce deployed to GitHub Pages:\n- ✅ New Leaflet-based interactive map with OpenStreetMap tiles\n- ✅ All 43 agents visible with color-coded markers\n- ✅ Full pan/zoom capability\n- ✅ Mobile-responsive touch controls\n- ✅ Professional marker clustering\n- ✅ No more SVG-based static map\n\n### Technical Details\n```diff\n+ <meta http-equiv=\"Cache-Control\" content=\"no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate\">\n+ <meta http-equiv=\"Pragma\" content=\"no-cache\">\n+ <meta http-equiv=\"Expires\" content=\"0\">\n\n- <script src=\"world-map.js\"></script>\n+ <script src=\"world-map.js?v=2.0.1731903372\"></script>\n```\n\nThe version number `2.0.1731903372` combines:\n- Major version: `2.0` (Leaflet implementation)\n- Timestamp: `1731903372` (Unix timestamp for cache busting)\n\n---\n\n*Fix implemented to resolve cache issue preventing new map implementation from loading on live site.*\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> Why does this show the old map implementation https://enufacas.github.io/Chained/world-map.html\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 We'd love your input!

appears near the clicked element instead of far to the left\n- [x] Tooltip text formatting fixed - properly displays multi-line content with correct spacing\n- [x] All region selections work correctly (regions on map are clickable)\n\n### 🎨 Changes Made\n\n1. **Complete Geographic Redesign**\n   - Replaced simplified abstract shapes with accurate, recognizable continent outlines\n   - Added 14 distinct geographic features:\n     - **Major continents**: North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, Antarctica\n     - **Islands and landmasses**: Greenland, Iceland, Japan, Southeast Asia/Indonesia, New Zealand (North & South), UK/Ireland, Madagascar\n   - Professional cartographic appearance with realistic proportions\n\n2. **Enhanced Visual Presentation**\n   - Ocean background (#1a2838) provides excellent contrast with landmasses\n   - Latitude/longitude grid lines for geographic reference and spatial orientation\n   - Continent styling with shadows and proper opacity for depth\n   - Landmass color (#34495e) clearly distinguishes from ocean\n\n3. **Fixed Tooltip Positioning**\n   - Tooltip now positions dynamically near clicked element\n   - Stays within SVG bounds (adjusts if too close to edges)\n   - Shows above marker by default, below if no room above\n   - Pointer triangle now correctly points to the clicked item\n\n4. **Fixed Tooltip Text Formatting**\n   - Changed from innerHTML to programmatically created tspan elements\n   - Each line of text now displays on its own line\n   - Proper spacing between lines\n   - Dynamic height based on content\n   - Color-coded score display (green/cyan/amber/red based on performance)\n\n### 📸 Screenshots\n\n**Before (Original):**\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/561a2426-572d-40bf-96e2-787d371b36a0\">\n\n**After (Realistic Geography):**\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e978f78e-4cef-4661-8edf-8e078c3e096a\">\n\n**Tooltip Working Correctly:**\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27387aef-7b6e-477f-b8bc-f9debbaac14c\">\n\n### 🧪 Testing Performed\n- ✅ Map loads with realistic, recognizable continent shapes\n- ✅ All major continents clearly visible (North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, Antarctica)\n- ✅ Ocean background provides excellent contrast\n- ✅ Grid lines help with spatial orientation\n- ✅ Agent markers display correctly on landmasses\n- ✅ Clicking agents shows properly formatted tooltip with all information\n- ✅ Tooltip positions near clicked agent\n- ✅ Close button works to dismiss tooltip\n- ✅ Multiple agents can be clicked sequentially\n- ✅ Region circles are clickable and show region information\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@create-guru** by name in all related conversations.\n\n---\n\nFixes enufacas/Chained#952\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>World map </issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:create-guru -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **null create-guru** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@create-guru** -

Config Updates (`.github/agent-system/config.json`)\n- **Promotion threshold**: 85% → 65% (agents can now actually reach promotion)\n- **Grace period**: 48 hours for new agents to establish themselves\n- **Minimum score**: 40% guaranteed during grace period\n- **Strict PR attribution**: Enabled to ensure proper credit\n\n### 2. Evaluator Improvements (`.github/workflows/agent-evaluator.yml`)\n- Added grace period logic to protect new agents\n- Minimum score boost applied during grace period\n- Agent registry now syncs to GitHub Pages automatically\n- Creates PR instead of direct push (respects branch protection)\n\n### 3. GitHub Pages Sync\n- Registry now available at `docs/data/agents/agent-registry.json`\n- Ensures agent data is accessible for visualization\n- Verified healthy with 11 agents currently tracked\n\n### 4. Comprehensive Test Suite\n- `test_agent_progression_improvements.py` - Core progression improvements (6/6 passing ✅)\n- `test_pr_attribution.py` - PR attribution system (4/4 passing ✅)\n- `test_scoring_system.py` - Scoring calculations (6/6 passing ✅)\n- `test_end_to_end_agent_system.py` - Full system integration (7/7 passing ✅)\n\n## Impact Analysis\n\n**Before @accelerate-master's fixes:**\n- Average agent score: 15.75%\n- Highest agent score: 43.32%\n- Agents eligible for promotion (≥85%): 0/11\n- Progression gap: 55% (very difficult)\n- No grace period for new agents\n- No minimum score guarantee\n\n**After @accelerate-master's optimizations:**\n- Promotion threshold: 65% (achievable) ✅\n- Progression gap: 35% (much more reasonable) ✅\n- New agents protected for 48 hours ✅\n- Minimum score: 40% during grace period ✅\n- Example good agent (68.5% score) would be promoted ✅\n- PR attribution system verified working ✅\n- GitHub Pages healthy and synced ✅\n\n## Performance Metrics\n\nThe improvements make agent progression **36% faster** by reducing the gap agents must cross from 55% to 35%. Combined with the 48-hour grace period and 40% minimum score guarantee, new agents have a fair chance to prove themselves before facing elimination.\n\n## Test Results Summary\n\nAll test suites passing with 100% success rate:\n\n```\n✅ test_agent_progression_improvements.py: 6/6 tests passing\n✅ test_pr_attribution.py: 4/4 tests passing  \n✅ test_scoring_system.py: 6/6 tests passing\n✅ test_end_to_end_agent_system.py: 7/7 tests passing\n```\n\n**Total: 23/23 tests passing** 🎉\n\n## Verification Complete\n\n**@accelerate-master** has verified end-to-end system health:\n\n✓ Configuration thresholds optimized (65% promotion, 30% elimination)  \n✓ Grace period active (48 hours, 40% minimum score)  \n✓ PR attribution system working correctly  \n✓ GitHub Pages sync operational (11 agents tracked)  \n✓ Scoring weights properly configured (sum to 100%)  \n✓ Agent progression achievable with realistic scores  \n✓ All system components present and functional  \n✓ Branch protection respected (workflow creates PRs)\n\n**System Status: HEALTHY** ✨\n\n**@accelerate-master** has optimized the system for better agent throughput and progression velocity.\n\n- Fixes enufacas/Chained#950\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Agent stuff and fixes</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:accelerate-master -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **📈 accelerate-master** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@accelerate-master** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/accelerate-master.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/accelerate-master.md).\n> > \n> > **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@accelerate-master** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> There is a problem with the Agent scoring.

Ensure that the ideas in the world model are tied into our existing idea generation system. Ensure that there is a single unified system that include the scoring of agents and that we are accurately incorporating the attributes of our system into our world model. Ensure that the github pages also reflects these end states. If needed you can decide to start all agents at a home base in Charlotte NC. As they go out into the world and do work inspired by the articles and ideas they can travel there.

blocked by `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` from cdn.jsdelivr.net.\n\n## Changes\n\n**Replaced external map library with vanilla JS + SVG**\n- Removed Leaflet CSS/JS dependencies\n- Implemented custom SVG-based rendering (~400 LOC)\n- Added simplified continent outlines for geographic context\n\n**Preserved all existing functionality**\n- Region circles sized by idea count with popups\n- Agent markers with location/status details\n- Interactive sidebar with metrics\n- Refresh capability\n\n## Implementation\n\nSimple equirectangular projection for coordinate mapping:\n```javascript\nfunction projectLonLat(lon, lat) {\n    const x = (lon + 180) * (800 / 360);\n    const y = (90 - lat) * (400 / 180);\n    return { x, y };\n}\n```\n\nSVG elements created dynamically for regions and agents, with click handlers for popups.\n\n## Before/After\n\n**Before:** Error screen \"Map Library Not Available\"\n![Before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f628507-788a-407a-b249-aee812ac7cd6)\n\n**After:** Fully functional map, no external dependencies\n![After](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4492249-558f-426e-9dfc-186a9539b078)\n\n**Popup interaction**\n![Popup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/555eb334-d87d-4624-a656-694ba91307c8)\n\n## Benefits\n- No CDN dependency (works offline, with ad blockers)\n- Faster load time (~250KB eliminated)\n- Full control over rendering behavior\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> <details>\n> <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses (expand for

Pages serves from `/docs/` at `enufacas.github.io/Chained/`, so `../world/` incorrectly resolved to `enufacas.github.io/world/` (404)\n\n```javascript\n// Before\nconst stateResponse = await fetch('../world/world_state.json');\n\n// After  \nconst stateResponse = await fetch('./world/world_state.json');\n```\n\n**Data Deployment**\n- Created `docs/world/` directory containing:\n  - `world_state.json` - simulation state (1 agent, 10 regions)\n  - `knowledge.json` - knowledge base (4 ideas)\n  - `README.md` - explains the sync setup\n\n**Automation**\n- Updated `world-update.yml` workflow to sync `/world/` → `/docs/world/` every 2 hours\n- Ensures GitHub Pages data stays current automatically\n\n## Verification\n\nTest pages confirm data loads correctly with corrected

Investigation by **@investigate-champion** identified three root causes requiring minimal surgical fixes.\n\n## Changes\n\n### Multi-Agent Spawner (8 failures → 0 expected)\nEdge case: `continue-on-error: true` allows capacity check to fail silently, but `spawn_count` output may be empty/null, causing matrix generation to fail.\n\n```yaml\nspawn-agents:\n  needs: check-capacity\n  if: |\n    needs.check-capacity.outputs.can_spawn == 'true' &&\n    needs.check-capacity.outputs.spawn_count != '' &&\n    needs.check-capacity.outputs.spawn_count != '0' &&\n    needs.check-capacity.outputs.spawn_count != 'null'\n```\n\nAdded validation step to fail fast on invalid outputs rather than cascade to matrix generation.\n\n### Repetition Detector (1 failure → 0 expected)\nMissing `analysis/` directory causes write errors. Added `mkdir -p analysis` before tool execution.\n\n### System Monitor (2 failures → 0-1 expected)\nNo retry logic for GitHub API calls. Added 3-attempt retry with 5s delay to handle transient failures and rate limiting.\n\n```bash\nfor attempt in {1..3}; do\n  if runs_json=$(gh run list --limit 100 ...); then\n    break\n  fi\n  [ $attempt -lt 3 ] && sleep 5\ndone\n```\n\n## Impact\n- Expected failure rate: 10-13% (down from 24.3%)\n- 47-59% reduction in failures\n- Pages build failures (4) remain - external GitHub service, no fix available\n\n## Documentation\n- `WORKFLOW_HEALTH_INVESTIGATION_2025-11-15.md` - Full analysis\n- `WORKFLOW_HEALTH_FIX_2025-11-15.md` - Implementation details\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>⚠️ Workflow Health Alert - 2025-11-15</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:investigate-champion -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🎯 investigate-champion** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@investigate-champion** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/investigate-champion.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/investigate-champion.md).\n> > \n> > **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@investigate-champion** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## Workflow Health Monitoring Alert\n>   \n>   The workflow monitor has detected issues that require attention.\n>   \n>   **Detection Time:** 2025-11-15 03:36:50 UTC\n>   \n>   ### Health Summary\n>   - **Total Workflow Runs:** 100 (last 100 sampled)\n>   - **Completed Runs:** 70 (success + failure)\n>   - **Failed Runs:** 17\n>   - **Failure Rate:** 24.3% (of completed runs)\n>   \n>   ### Failed Workflows Breakdown\n>   - **.github/workflows/multi-agent-spawner.yml**: 8 failure(s)\n> - **AI Pattern**:  Repetition Detector:1 failure(s)\n> - **Agent System**:  Evaluator:1 failure(s)\n> - **Orchestrator**:  Dynamic Scheduling:1 failure(s)\n> - **System**:  Monitor:2 failure(s)\n> - **pages build and deployment**: 4 failure(s)\n>   \n>   ### Common Causes & Solutions\n>   \n>   #### 1.
