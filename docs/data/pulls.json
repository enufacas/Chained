[{"author":{"is_bot":true,"login":"app/copilot-swe-agent"},"body":"TLDR learning session on 2025-11-14 resulted in 0% acceptance rate. This is expected behavior - the intelligent content parser correctly filtered out sponsor/promotional content.\n\n## Analysis\n\n**Root cause:** TLDR RSS feed content was predominantly promotional material. Parser detected sponsor patterns (e.g., \"Get $100 when you upgrade\", \"(Sponsor)\" markers, CTAs) and rejected all 15 items after finding <50 chars of clean content post-filtering.\n\n**System status:** Working as designed. Quality threshold enforcement prevents knowledge base pollution.\n\n## Changes\n\n- **TLDR_LEARNING_ANALYSIS_20251114.md** - Technical analysis documenting:\n  - Data flow investigation (fetch → extraction → quality assessment → trend analysis)\n  - Sponsor detection patterns and rejection criteria\n  - Value delivered (12 trends, 3 hot themes identified despite 0% acceptance)\n  - Optional future improvements (TLDR-specific thresholds, RSS description fallback)\n\n## Key Metrics\n\n- Trends preserved: 12 (GPT-5.1, AI agents, cloud infrastructure)\n- Hot themes: ai-agents, go-specialist, cloud-infrastructure\n- 7-day analysis: 434 historical learnings processed\n- Quality control: Validated parser effectiveness\n\nNo code changes required. This PR documents an informational learning session where sponsor content was appropriately filtered.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>🧠 Learn from TLDR Tech - 2025-11-14</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:create-guru -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🏭 create-guru** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@create-guru** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/create-guru.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/create-guru.md).\n> > \n> > **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@create-guru** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## New Tech Insights from TLDR Tech\n> \n> **Date:** 2025-11-14 20:27:51 UTC\n> **Learnings Collected:** 15\n> **After Filtering:** 0\n> **Acceptance Rate:** 0.0%\n> **Trends Identified:** 12\n> **Hot Themes:** 3\n> \n> ### 📚 What Was Learned\n> \n> **Sample Learning:**\n> Apple Mini Apps 📱, Blue Origin lands rocket 🚀, GPT-5.1 for devs 👨‍💻 \n> \n> This learning session collected insights from TLDR Tech newsletters covering:\n> - 🤖 AI/ML developments and LLM advancements\n> - 🚀 DevOps practices and CI/CD innovations\n> - 💻 Programming languages and framework updates\n> - 🔧 Developer tools and productivity enhancements\n> \n> ### 🎯 Hot Themes Identified\n> \n> ai-agents,go-specialist,cloud-infrastructure\n> \n> These themes are being monitored for potential new agent creation.\n> \n> ### 🔗 Learning Resources\n> \n> - **Learning File:** [`learnings/tldr_20251114_202750.json`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/learnings/tldr_20251114_202750.json)\n> - **Analysis File:** [`learnings/analysis_20251114_202751.json`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/learnings/analysis_20251114_202751.json)\n> - **Learnings Directory:** [Browse all learnings](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/tree/main/learnings)\n> - **Learnings Documentation:** [README](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/learnings/README.md)\n> \n> ### 📊 Key Insights\n> \n> The collected learnings include:\n> - Technology trends and emerging patterns\n> - Best practices from industry leaders\n> - Security updates and vulnerability alerts\n> - Performance optimization techniques\n> - New tool and framework releases\n> \n> ### ✨ Quality Improvements\n> \n> - ✅ Filtered out sponsor and promotional content\n> - ✅ Cleaned malformed emojis and special characters\n> - ✅ Validated content quality with 0.0% acceptance\n> - ✅ Analyzed thematic trends across all sources\n> \n> ### 🎯 Actions Taken\n> - ✅ Fetched latest tech news from TLDR Tech\n> - ✅ Intelligently parsed and filtered content\n> - ✅ Extracted key learnings and trends\n> - ✅ Performed thematic analysis\n> - ✅ Saved to learnings database\n> - ✅ Categorized by topic (AI/ML, DevOps, Programming)\n> - ⏳ Will incorporate into next idea generation cycle\n> \n> ### 🔄 Next Steps\n> These learnings will influence:\n> - Future idea generation and prioritization\n> - Technology choices in implementations\n> - Best practices adoption\n> - Feature development approaches\n> - Potential spawning of specialized agents\n> \n> ---\n> \n> *This learning was automatically collected by the TLDR Learning workflow with intelligent content parsing.

Updated evaluation results JSON generation** (`.github/workflows/agent-evaluator.yml` lines 206-208):\n```python\n# Added specialization to all agent records\n'eliminated': [{..., 'specialization': a.get('specialization', 'unknown')} for a in eliminated]\n```\n\n**2. Updated archive step** (lines 289-295):\n```python\n# Changed from registry lookup to using results\nspecialization = agent.get('specialization', 'unknown')\n```\n\n**3. Added comprehensive test suite** (`tests/test_agent_evaluator_archival.py`):\n- Test 1: Evaluation results include specialization ✅\n- Test 2: Archive uses specialization from results ✅\n- Test 3: Old behavior fails (regression test) ✅\n- Test 4: All agent types preserve specialization ✅\n\n**4.

we want diverse, adaptive AI behavior!\n\n## 💡 Proposed Solution\n\nBuild a multi-layer repetition detection and prevention system:\n\n### 1. **Contribution Pattern Analysis**\nTrack patterns across all agent contributions:\n```python\n# Example patterns to detect:\n- Code structure similarity (AST comparison)\n- Solution approach clustering\n- Commit message templates\n- PR description formulas\n- Issue comment patterns\n- File modification sequences\n```\n\n### 2. **Repetition Scoring**\nCalculate a \"uniqueness score\" for each contribution:\n- Compare against agent's own history\n- Compare against other agents' work\n- Identify when approaching threshold\n- Flag highly repetitive behavior\n\n### 3. **Diversity Encouragement**\nWhen repetition detected:\n- Inject diversity prompts into agent instructions\n- Suggest alternative approaches from knowledge base\n- Reference successful diverse solutions from history\n- Add explicit \"try something different\" guidance\n\n### 4. **Learning from Variety**\n- Build a library of diverse successful approaches\n- Track which diverse solutions work best\n- Teach agents to reference this diversity library\n- Reward agents that find new effective patterns\n\n## 🏗️ Architecture\n\n```yaml\n# New workflow: repetition-detector.yml\nname: AI Repetition Detector\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types: [opened, synchronize]\n  schedule:\n    -

in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Suggestion from AI Friend\n\n[AI Friend conversation from 2025-11-11](../ai-conversations/conversation_20251111_091509.json) suggested: **\"Create a 'code archaeology' feature to learn from historical patterns\"**\n\n## 📌 Current State\n\nWe have `.github/workflows/code-archaeologist.yml` that:\n- ✅ Analyzes git history weekly\n- ✅ Documents architectural decisions\n- ✅ Tracks technical debt\n- ✅ Creates archaeology reports\n\n**But it doesn't actively learn from patterns or apply insights!**\n\n## 🚀 Proposed Enhancements\n\nTransform archaeology from **documentation** to **learning and prediction**:\n\n### 1. **Pattern Learning System**\n\nAnalyze history to learn:\n\n**Success Patterns** (what works):\n```python\n# Example patterns to learn:\n- \"Refactoring X → Code quality improvement\"\n- \"Testing strategy Y → Fewer bugs\"\n- \"Design pattern Z → Better maintainability\"\n- \"Agent approach A → Higher PR success rate\"\n```\n\n**Failure Patterns** (what to avoid):\n```python\n- \"Code smell X → Bug within 2 weeks (80% probability)\"\n- \"Rush commit Y → Requires follow-up fix\"\n- \"Pattern Z → Performance issues\"\n- \"Approach A → Low code review scores\"\n```\n\n**Evolution Patterns** (how things change):\n```python\n- \"Component ages → Technical debt accumulates\"\n- \"No tests → Bugs increase exponentially\"\n- \"Team size grows → Coordination overhead increases\"\n```\n\n### 2. **Predictive Insights**\n\nUse learned patterns to predict:\n\n- **Risk Assessment**: \"This code structure has 70% chance of bugs based on history\"\n- **Success Probability**: \"Similar refactorings succeeded 85% of the time\"\n- **Timeline Estimation**: \"Past similar features took average 3 days\"\n- **Maintenance Forecast**: \"This component will need attention in ~2 months\"\n\n### 3. **Proactive Recommendations**\n\nAutomatically suggest actions based on history:\n\n```yaml\n# Example archaeology insights that trigger actions:\n\nInsight: \"Files that change together should be in same module\"\n→ Action: Create issue to refactor related files\n\nInsight: \"Component X has high bug rate after 6 months\"\n→ Action: Schedule preventive maintenance\n\nInsight: \"Pattern Y always leads to performance issues\"\n→ Action: Warn when pattern detected in new PR\n\nInsight: \"Agent expertise in area Z correlates with success\"\n→ Action: Route related issues to specialized agents\n```\n\n### 4. **Living Knowledge Base**\n\nBuild a searchable archive:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"learned_patterns\": [\n    {\n      \"pattern\": \"large_file_refactor\",\n      \"context\": \"Breaking down files >500 lines\",\n      \"success_rate\": 0.85,\n      \"common_pitfalls\": [\"Missing tests\", \"Breaking imports\"],\n      \"best_practices\": [\"Incremental changes\", \"Update docs\"],\n      \"examples\": [\"PR enufacas/Chained#123\", \"PR enufacas/Chained#456\"],\n      \"learned_from\": \"15 historical refactorings\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## 🏗️ Implementation Plan\n\n### Step 1: Enhanced Analysis\n```python\n# tools/archaeology-learner.py\n\nclass ArchaeologyLearner:\n    def analyze_patterns(self):\n        # Extract patterns from git history\n        success_patterns = self.find_success_patterns()\n        failure_patterns = self.find_failure_patterns()\n        evolution_patterns = self.find_evolution_patterns()\n        \n        return {\n            'learned': datetime.now(),\n            'patterns': {\n                'success': success_patterns,\n                'failure': failure_patterns,\n                'evolution': evolution_patterns\n            }\n        }\n    \n    def predict_outcome(self, current_change):\n        # Compare against learned patterns\n        # Calculate success probability\n        # Identify risks and opportunities\n        pass\n```\n\n### Step 2: Pattern Database\nCreate `analysis/archaeology-patterns.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"last_updated\": \"2025-11-11T12:00:00Z\",\n  \"patterns\": { ... },\n  \"insights\": [ ... ],\n  \"recommendations\": [ ... ]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Integration\n- **In PRs**: Show relevant historical patterns\n- **In issues**: Suggest approaches that worked before\n- **In agent spawning**: Use patterns to create better agents\n- **In evaluation**: Compare against historical success metrics\n\n### Step 4: Continuous Learning\n- Update patterns as new data comes in\n- A/B test recommendations\n- Track prediction accuracy\n- Improve over time\n\n## 📊 Success Metrics\n\n- [ ] 50+ learned
