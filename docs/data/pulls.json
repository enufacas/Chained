The Copilot agent step appears to be sending large payloads (full diffs / full logs) to external APIs which trigger 413 and cause retries and 502s. We need a PR that updates the workflow to prevent oversized payloads and provide a safe fallback (upload artifacts) when payloads are too big.\n\nGoals\n\n1. Prevent large inline payloads being sent to external APIs (limit diffs, limit per-file hunk size, limit number of files).\n2. Avoid referencing a fixed branch name ('main') — instead detect default branch or use origin/HEAD.\n3. Limit captured logs to relevant snippets (grep errors + tail) and upload full logs as artifact when needed.\n4. Add a robust retry/fallback: if external API responds with 413 upload compressed artifact and send only a short reference.\n5. Keep changes minimal and safe: only modify the failing workflow file at dynamic/copilot-swe-agent/copilot and add a helper script inline.\n\nProposed changes (detailed and actionable)\n\n1) Replace the problematic git diff step with a new step that:\n   - fetches the default branch shallowly (fetch-depth:1)\n   - computes changed files via git diff --name-only between default branch and HEAD, limited to MAX_FILES (default 200)\n   - for each file include only a small hunk (MAX_BYTES_PER_FILE default 10000 bytes)\n   - build a compact payload file compact_payload.txt containing hunks + an errors summary (grep for ERROR, Traceback, Exception, and tail last LOG_LINES lines)\n\n2) Add an API call wrapper that posts compact_payload.txt to the Copilot endpoint and checks HTTP status.

The Copilot agent step appears to be sending large payloads (full diffs / full logs) to external APIs which trigger 413 and cause retries and 502s.

The PR will include an additional subsequent step that conditionally uploads the compressed payload artifact when the previous step indicated it via outputs or via checking for the file compact_payload_with_header.txt.gz.\n> \n> - The PR will add a follow-up step using actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the compressed payload if present, and to send a small metadata-only request to the Copilot API with the artifact name and run info.\n> \n> - This change focuses on the workflow path: dynamic/copilot-swe-agent/copilot and does not modify source code in the repository.\n> \n> Please create a branch and open a pull request that implements the workflow change described above. Update the file dynamic/copilot-swe-agent/copilot accordingly and include any small reordering of steps needed so the artifact upload runs only on the indicated exit codes.

Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n>   **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n>   \n>   #### 3. Missing Secrets\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n>   **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n>   \n>   #### 4. External Dependencies\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n>   **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n>   \n>   #### 5. Configuration Issues\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n>   **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n>   \n>   ### Recommended Actions\n>   1. **First:** Check if label-related (see Quick Fix above)\n>   2. Review the failed workflows breakdown above\n>   3. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs\n>   4. Focus on workflows with multiple failures first\n>   5.
