JSON export with full pattern match metadata (file, line, confidence, context)\n  - Console output with categorized summaries and actionable recommendations\n  - Verbose mode for detailed findings per file\n\n## Pattern Coverage\n\n**Code**: Type hints, docstrings, error handling, context managers, dataclasses | long functions (>50 lines), deep nesting (>4 levels), magic numbers\n\n**Workflow**: Pinned action versions, secrets management, timeouts, error handling | unpinned versions, hardcoded credentials\n\n**Security**: Input validation, secure random | SQL injection patterns, hardcoded secrets\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n# Analyze repository\npython3 tools/cross-repo-pattern-matcher.py --repo . -o report.json\n\n# Results on Chained: 160 files, 4134 patterns, score 100/100 in ~9s\n```\n\n## Testing & Documentation\n\n- 9 test cases (100% pass): pattern detection, scoring, export, confidence validation\n- Complete README with pattern reference, integration examples, CI/CD patterns\n- Interactive examples for cross-repo comparison and tool integration\n- Implementation summary with performance metrics\n\n## Integration Points\n\n- Complements `code-analyzer.py` (historical patterns) and `dependency-flow-analyzer.py` (architecture)\n- CLI compatible with existing tool conventions\n- Extensible detector pattern for adding new languages/categories\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>🤖 AI Generated Idea: Build a cross-repository pattern matcher for best practices</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:investigate-champion -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🎯 investigate-champion** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@investigate-champion** -

Updated evaluation results JSON generation** (`.github/workflows/agent-evaluator.yml` lines 206-208):\n```python\n# Added specialization to all agent records\n'eliminated': [{..., 'specialization': a.get('specialization', 'unknown')} for a in eliminated]\n```\n\n**2. Updated archive step** (lines 289-295):\n```python\n# Changed from registry lookup to using results\nspecialization = agent.get('specialization', 'unknown')\n```\n\n**3. Added comprehensive test suite** (`tests/test_agent_evaluator_archival.py`):\n- Test 1: Evaluation results include specialization ✅\n- Test 2: Archive uses specialization from results ✅\n- Test 3: Old behavior fails (regression test) ✅\n- Test 4: All agent types preserve specialization ✅\n\n**4. Added documentation**:\n- `AGENT_DELETION_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Complete analysis and solution\n- `AGENT_DELETION_FIX_DIAGRAM.md` - Visual flow diagrams\n\n### Testing Results ✅\n\nAll tests pass successfully:\n```\n✅ Evaluation results include specialization\n✅ Archive uses specialization from results\n✅ Old behavior fails (regression test)\n✅ All agent types preserve specialization\n✅ Complete workflow simulation passes\n✅ YAML syntax validated\n```\n\n### Visual Overview\n\nSee `AGENT_DELETION_FIX_DIAGRAM.md` for detailed flow diagrams showing:\n- Before/After comparison\n- Data flow through the workflow\n- Code changes side-by-side\n- Key differences table\n\n### Impact\n\n**Before the Fix:**\n- ❌ Eliminated agents were skipped during archival\n- ❌ Agent definitions were not properly tracked\n- ❌ Specialization information was lost\n- ❌ No visibility into archival failures\n\n**After the Fix:**\n- ✅ All eliminated agents are properly archived\n- ✅ Specialization information is preserved\n- ✅ Clear error messages when definitions are missing\n- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage prevents regression\n- ✅ No agents skipped during archival process\n\n### Files Changed\n\n- `.github/workflows/agent-evaluator.yml` - Fixed evaluation and archival logic\n- `tests/test_agent_evaluator_archival.py` - Added comprehensive test suite\n- `AGENT_DELETION_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed documentation\n- `AGENT_DELETION_FIX_DIAGRAM.md` - Visual flow diagrams\n\n### Ready for Review\n\nAll changes have been committed, tested, and validated. The fix is ready for merge.\n\n**Total commits**: 3\n1. Fix agent deletion: Include specialization in evaluation results\n2. Add comprehensive test suite and documentation\n3.
