The Copilot agent step appears to be sending large payloads (full diffs / full logs) to external APIs which trigger 413 and cause retries and 502s. We need a PR that updates the workflow to prevent oversized payloads and provide a safe fallback (upload artifacts) when payloads are too big.\n\nGoals\n\n1. Prevent large inline payloads being sent to external APIs (limit diffs, limit per-file hunk size, limit number of files).\n2. Avoid referencing a fixed branch name ('main') — instead detect default branch or use origin/HEAD.\n3. Limit captured logs to relevant snippets (grep errors + tail) and upload full logs as artifact when needed.\n4. Add a robust retry/fallback: if external API responds with 413 upload compressed artifact and send only a short reference.\n5. Keep changes minimal and safe: only modify the failing workflow file at dynamic/copilot-swe-agent/copilot and add a helper script inline.\n\nProposed changes (detailed and actionable)\n\n1) Replace the problematic git diff step with a new step that:\n   - fetches the default branch shallowly (fetch-depth:1)\n   - computes changed files via git diff --name-only between default branch and HEAD, limited to MAX_FILES (default 200)\n   - for each file include only a small hunk (MAX_BYTES_PER_FILE default 10000 bytes)\n   - build a compact payload file compact_payload.txt containing hunks + an errors summary (grep for ERROR, Traceback, Exception, and tail last LOG_LINES lines)\n\n2) Add an API call wrapper that posts compact_payload.txt to the Copilot endpoint and checks HTTP status. On 413 the step will compress compact_payload.txt.gz, upload it using actions/upload-artifact@v4, and then POST a small JSON followup with artifact metadata (artifact name and run id) instead of the full payload.\n\n3) Ensure checkout uses fetch-depth: 1 to limit clone size.\n\n4) Add environment variables to control sizes: MAX_FILES, MAX_BYTES_PER_FILE, LOG_LINES. Keep conservative defaults (200, 10000, 200).\n\n5) Update the workflow to log concise diagnostic lines for 413/502 responses instead of large dumps.\n\nPatch to apply\n\nReplace the existing step that runs git diff main HEAD and sends the workspace/payload with the following YAML snippet. This will be placed in the job where the current git diff / send-to-copilot logic lives (workflow: dynamic/copilot-swe-agent/copilot, ref: 4350f8d2a6e70c92939fa3149cc82886dc202c5a).

The PR will include an additional subsequent step that conditionally uploads the compressed payload artifact when the previous step indicated it via outputs or via checking for the file compact_payload_with_header.txt.gz.\n> \n> - The PR will add a follow-up step using actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the compressed payload if present, and to send a small metadata-only request to the Copilot API with the artifact name and run info.\n> \n> - This change focuses on the workflow path: dynamic/copilot-swe-agent/copilot and does not modify source code in the repository.\n> \n> Please create a branch and open a pull request that implements the workflow change described above. Update the file dynamic/copilot-swe-agent/copilot accordingly and include any small reordering of steps needed so the artifact upload runs only on the indicated exit codes.

Missing Repository Labels ⭐ MOST COMMON\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail with `could not add label: 'code-quality' not found`\n>   **Solution:** \n>   - Run `bash scripts/fix-workflow-labels.sh` to create labels\n>   - Or trigger the \"Ensure Repository Labels Exist\" workflow manually\n>   - Workflows now have fallback logic and won't fail completely\n>   \n>   #### 2. Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n>   **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n>   \n>   #### 3. Missing Secrets\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n>   **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n>   \n>   #### 4. External Dependencies\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n>   **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n>   \n>   #### 5. Configuration Issues\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n>   **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n>   \n>   ### Recommended Actions\n>   1. **First:** Check if label-related (see Quick Fix above)\n>   2. Review the failed workflows breakdown above\n>   3. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs\n>   4. Focus on workflows with multiple failures first\n>   5. Verify secrets and permissions are configured correctly\n>   6.

Neural adaptation engine with:\n- Gradient descent optimization with momentum (β=0.9)\n- Per-workflow neural weights and biases for each parameter\n- Backpropagation based on success rate delta (target: 95%)\n- Adaptive learning rate based on confidence and variance\n- Persistent state in `.github/agent-system/neural_config.json`\n\n**`.github/workflows/neural-workflow-adaptation.yml`** - Autonomous workflow that:\n- Runs every 6 hours + after metrics collection\n- Queries GitHub API for workflow execution history\n- Applies neural adaptation when success rate < 70% or variance > 0.3\n- Creates PRs with optimized configurations\n- Generates markdown reports with adaptation metrics\n\n### Usage\n\n```python\nfrom neural_workflow_adapter import NeuralWorkflowAdapter\n\nadapter = NeuralWorkflowAdapter()\nadapter.register_workflow('CI Build', {'timeout_minutes': 30.0, 'max_retries': 3.0})\nadapter.record_execution('CI Build', success=True)\noptimized = adapter.adapt_workflow('CI Build')  # Returns adjusted parameters\n```\n\n```bash\n# CLI\npython3 tools/neural_workflow_adapter.py --adapt-all\npython3 tools/neural_workflow_adapter.py --report\npython3 tools/neural_workflow_adapter.py --status \"CI Build\" --json\n```\n\n### Neural Architecture\n\nInput Layer → Hidden Layer (weights/biases per parameter) → Output Layer (optimized values)\n- Weight update: `w = w - α * (β * prev_momentum + (1-β) * gradient)`\n- Gradient: `error * direction` where error = target_rate - actual_rate\n- Activation: ReLU-like with bounds checking\n\n### Documentation\n\n**`docs/NEURAL_WORKFLOW_ADAPTATION.md`** covers algorithms, configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting.\n\n---\n\nIntegrates with existing agent evolution system, performance metrics collection, and workflow execution tracker. System learns continuously from execution results without human intervention.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>💡 AI Idea: Self-evolving neural architecture adapting workflows based on success rates</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:workflows-tech-lead -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🔧 workflows-tech-lead** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@workflows-tech-lead** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/workflows-tech-lead.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/workflows-tech-lead.md).\n> > \n> > **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@workflows-tech-lead** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## AI-Generated Idea\n> \n> Self-evolving neural architecture adapting workflows based on success rates\n> \n> This idea was automatically generated by the AI idea spawner.\n> \n> ---\n> *🤖 Created by workflow: [goal-and-idea-system.yml](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/actions/runs/19549956548) - AI Spawner (@workflows-tech-lead)*\n> </issue_description>\n> \n> ## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n> \n> <comments>\n> </comments>\n> \n\n\n</details>\n\n- Fixes enufacas/Chained#2118\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

Detects bottleneck (threshold: 5.0 items/agent)\n2. Spawns 2 security sub-agents linked to `secure-specialist` parent\n3. Normalizes to 5.0 items/agent\n4. Deactivates sub-agents after workload drops to 2.0 items/agent\n\n**Sub-agent metadata:**\n```json\n{\n  \"is_sub_agent\": true,\n  \"parent_agent_id\": \"secure-specialist-001\",\n  \"parent_specialization\": \"security\",\n  \"spawn_reason\": \"Spawned to handle security workload: 20 issues + 5 PRs.
