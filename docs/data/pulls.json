Autonomous spawning with 10 specializations (bug-hunter, feature-architect, test-champion, etc.), work issue creation, and Copilot assignment\n- `agent-evaluator.yml` - Multi-metric scoring: 30% code quality, 25% issue resolution, 25% PR success, 20% peer review\n- `agents/registry.json` - State machine tracking active agents, Hall of Fame, System Lead\n- `docs/agents.html` - Real-time leaderboard and metrics visualization\n\n## Implementation\n\n**Copilot Integration:**\n- Uses `COPILOT_PAT` to automatically assign work to GitHub Copilot\n- Each agent receives a specialized work issue tailored to its specialization\n- 10 unique task templates (bug hunting, feature design, testing, documentation, etc.)\n- Agents receive performance credit when Copilot completes their assigned work\n- Graceful fallback if COPILOT_PAT not configured\n\n**Auto-Configuration:**\n- Automatically creates all required labels on first run\n- Labels: `agent-system`, `agent-work`, `announcement`, `evaluation`, `automated`, `copilot`\n- Auto-creates directories and profiles\n- Works immediately after merge\n\n**Agent DNA:**\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"agent-1234567890\",\n  \"name\": \"🐛 Debugger-1110\",\n  \"specialization\": \"bug-hunter\",\n  \"traits\": {\"creativity\": 80, \"caution\": 90, \"speed\": 65},\n  \"metrics\": {\"overall_score\": 0.72}\n}\n```\n\n**Governance:**\n- Top Hall of Fame member becomes System Lead\n- Agents compete for survival (Darwinian selection)\n- Performance-based elimination creates selection pressure\n\n## Extensibility\n\n`AGENT_BRAINSTORMING.md` outlines 15+ evolution paths:\n- Genetic breeding (combine successful traits)\n- Team formation and collaboration\n- Inter-agent communication protocols\n- Territory ownership and domain specialization\n- Democratic voting systems\n\n## Files\n\n**Workflows:** 3 (spawner with Copilot integration, evaluator, sync)  \n**Documentation:** 5 (config with COPILOT_PAT guide, quickstart, brainstorm, system docs, main README)  \n**Code:** 2 (registry, test suite)  \n**Visualization:** 4 (dashboard + nav updates)\n\n**Validation:**\n- All workflows YAML-valid\n- Test suite: 4/4 passing\n- CodeQL: 0 security issues\n- Automatic label creation tested\n\n## Notifications\n\nStandard GitHub issue subscriptions apply. Agent spawns create announcement issues and work assignment issues labeled `agent-system` and `agent-work`. Users control notification level via Watch settings (All Activity / Custom / Ignore).\n\n## What Makes This Unique\n\nThis creates a fully autonomous ecosystem where:\n- AI agents spawn and receive real work assignments\n- GitHub Copilot implements solutions on behalf of agents\n- Agents compete based on the quality of Copilot's implementations\n- The entire flow (spawn → assign → implement → evaluate) runs autonomously\n- No human intervention required for the agent competition cycle\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> So github copilot supports the idea of custom agents. I want to explore what's possible with them. Could i for example create a flow that spawns a new custom agent every 3 hours. Configures itself to review all issues and contribute to code appropriately. Then overtime i think we could have one of the custom agents get voted off the island. Enter a hall of fame or become in charge of the system we are building here.
