Map library CDNs were blocked, causing blank screens. Code checked `worldState.regions` without verifying `worldState.agents` existed first, causing crashes.\n\n## Changes\n\n### Core Fixes\n- Fixed null reference bug: added `worldState.agents &&` check before array access\n- Added CDN fallback chain: unpkg.com → cdnjs.cloudflare.com → graceful degradation\n- Added SRI integrity hashes for security\n- Implemented fallback UI when Leaflet unavailable (sidebar continues showing all data)\n\n### Agent Visualization\n- Draw movement paths using `L.polyline()` with color-coded performance:\n  - Green (≥85%), Blue (≥50%), Orange (≥30%), Red (<30%)\n- Add waypoint markers (`L.circleMarker`) at each stop\n- Display journey progress, missions, and metrics in popups\n\n### Region & Context\n- Render regions as `L.circle()` sized by idea count: `radius = ideaCount × 5000`\n- Show agent count per region\n- Label significant locations (>5 ideas or home base)\n\n### Data Integration  \n- Use `world_state.json` as source of truth for locations\n- Three-tier priority: `location_region_id` → defaults → fallback\n- Display data freshness timestamp with color-coded status\n- Add loading states: ⏳ Loading... → ✅/⚠️\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\n// Agent path with color based on performance\nconst pathColor = score >= 0.85 ?

'#f59e0b' : '#ef4444';\n\nL.polyline(coordinates, {\n  color: pathColor,\n  weight: 2,\n  opacity: 0.6,\n  dashArray: '5, 10'\n}).addTo(pathLayers);\n\n// Region circle sized by ideas\nL.circle([region.lat, region.lng], {\n  radius: Math.max(5000, Math.min(50000, ideaCount * 5000)),\n  fillOpacity: 0.15\n}).addTo(regionLayers);\n```\n\n## Screenshots\n\n**Before** - Blank screen with no feedback:\n![Before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/218b8e28-3972-4d42-9eeb-e340b632060c)\n\n**After** - Fallback UI with full data access when Leaflet blocked:\n![After](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64c437da-658e-43af-8420-5d5afec7863c)\n\nWhen Leaflet loads properly, users see interactive map with agent markers, dashed path polylines, and region circles.\n\n## Documentation\nAdded `WORLD_MAP_README.md` (280 lines) covering data sources, Leaflet implementation, workflow integration, and troubleshooting.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> <details>\n> <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses (expand for details)</summary>\n>\n> #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules:\n>\n> - `cdn.jsdelivr.net`\n>   - Triggering command: `curl -sL REDACTED -o leaflet.css` (dns block)\n> - `unpkg.com`\n>   - Triggering command: `wget -q REDACTED -O leaflet.css` (dns block)\n>   - Triggering command: `wget -q REDACTED -O MarkerCluster.css` (dns block)\n>\n> If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either:\n>\n> - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled\n> - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to the custom allowlist in this repository's [Copilot coding agent settings](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/settings/copilot/coding_agent) (admins only)\n>\n> </details>\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> https://enufacas.github.io/Chained/world-map.html the map is not really representing the movement or location or accurate world state.

Missions were created but agents weren't assigned correctly, preventing work from starting.\n\n## Root Causes\n\nThree distinct issues:\n\n1. **Wrong agent info**: Script called `match-issue-to-agent.py \"agent-mission\"` → returned `meta-coordinator` instead of specified agent\n2. **Premature labeling**: `copilot-assigned` label added before GraphQL assignment → issues marked as assigned when they weren't\n3. **Missing pipeline stage**: Assignment not integrated into autonomous pipeline → 0-15 minute delay\n\n## Changes\n\n### Fix #1: Agent Info Retrieval\n`tools/assign-agent-directly.sh` line 34:\n\n```bash\n# Before: Generic match returns wrong agent\nagent_info=$(python3 tools/match-issue-to-agent.py \"agent-mission\" \"\" ...)\n\n# After: Direct lookup gets specified agent\nagent_info=$(python3 tools/get-agent-info.py info \"$matched_agent\" ...)\n```\n\n### Fix #2: Label Timing\n`tools/assign-agent-directly.sh`:\n\n```bash\n# Before: Label added at line 91, before assignment attempt\ngh issue edit --add-label \"copilot-assigned\"\n# ... GraphQL assignment might fail, but label stays\n\n# After: Label added at line 220, only after success check\nif successful_graphql_assignment; then\n  gh issue edit --add-label \"copilot-assigned\"\nfi\n```\n\n### Fix #3: Pipeline Integration\n`.github/workflows/autonomous-pipeline.yml`:\n\nAdded **Stage 4.75: Assign Agents to Missions** between Stage 4.5 (merge mission PR) and Stage 5 (self-reinforcement):\n\n```yaml\nassign-agents-to-missions:\n  needs: [agent-missions, merge-mission-pr]\n  if: needs.agent-missions.outputs.mission_count > 0 && inputs.skip_assignment != true\n  steps:\n    - run: |\n        jq -r '.[] | \"\\(.issue_number) \\(.agent_specialization)\"' created_missions.json | \\\n        while read -r issue_number agent_specialization; do\n          ./tools/assign-agent-directly.sh \"$issue_number\" \"$agent_specialization\"\n        done\n```\n\nAdded `skip_assignment` workflow input for manual control.\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Performance**: ~15 minutes faster (immediate vs waiting for scheduled workflow)\n- **Correctness**: Proper agent info, accurate label state\n- **Reliability**: Failed assignments don't block pipeline, scheduled workflow provides retry\n- **Backward compatible**: Existing workflows continue to work\n\n## Test Coverage\n\n- `tests/test_assign_agent_directly_fix.py` - Verifies correct agent retrieval\n- `tests/test_copilot_label_timing.py` - Verifies label ordering\n- Integration test validates end-to-end flow\n\nAll tests passing.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> The direct assignment of agents to missions is not working.

Investigation confirms scoring formulas are mathematically correct; the issue is 0% of agents have PRs recorded.\n\n## Root Cause\n\n**PR attribution broken**: `issue_history.json` shows `pr_number: null` for all resolved issues.\n\n**Impact**: 50% of weighted score inaccurate\n- `code_quality` (30%): defaults to 0.5 for 96% of agents\n- `pr_success` (20%): always 0.0\n- Result: artificial convergence at 0.43 (agents with issues) and 0.23 (agents without)\n\n```python\n# Example: Agent with 1 issue resolved\ncode_quality:      0.50 × 30% = 0.150  # DEFAULTED (should vary 0.0-1.0)\nissue_resolution:  1.00 × 20% = 0.200  # Correct\npr_success:        0.00 × 20% = 0.000  # WRONG (PR data missing)\npeer_review:       0.00 × 15% = 0.000  # Correct\ncreativity:        0.53 × 15% = 0.080  # Correct\n                              ───────\n                         Total = 0.430  # Converged score\n```\n\n## Solution Implemented\n\n**@assert-specialist** has implemented a multi-layered fix for PR attribution:\n\n### 1. Git-Based Fallback (`tools/agent-metrics-collector.py`)\n- **New method**: `_find_prs_via_git()` automatically activates when GitHub API returns 0 PRs\n- **How it works**: Parses git log for merge commits, extracts PR numbers, matches issue references\n- **Benefits**: Works without GitHub API, handles rate limits gracefully\n- **Lines**: +94 modifications\n\n### 2. Repair Tool (`tools/fix_pr_attribution.py`)\n- **Purpose**: One-time fix for existing `issue_history.json` (8 records with `pr_number: null`)\n- **Features**: \n  - Scans entire git history for PR → Issue mappings\n  - Creates backup before making changes\n  - Supports `--dry-run` for safe preview\n- **Lines**: 187 new lines\n\n### 3. Test Suite\n- **`test_git_pr_fallback.py`**: Validates git-based fallback logic (140 lines)\n- **`test_agent_scoring_accuracy.py`**: 6 comprehensive tests analyzing 25 agents\n  - Score calculation accuracy ✅\n  - Score diversity analysis ❌ (64% convergence detected)\n  - Code quality defaults ❌ (96% using default)\n  - PR attribution logic ❌ (0% PRs found)\n  - Activity correlation ✅\n  - Creativity diversity ❌ (64% identical)\n- **`test_pr_attribution_debug.py`**: Debug tool for investigating specific agents\n\n### 4.

Learning artifacts → `learnings/` directory\n2. World model updates → `world-update.yml` modifies JSON files\n3. Agents reacting → Selected by scoring algorithm\n4. 10-agent limit → `[:10]` slice enforced in code\n5. Agent movement → `location_region_id` updated in world state\n6. Mission issues → Created via `create_mission_issues.py`\n7. Labels created → API calls before issue creation\n8. Loop continuation → `self-reinforcement.yml` triggers `combined-learning.yml`\n\nSystem operates continuously on 8 AM/8 PM UTC learning schedule plus daily midnight self-reinforcement.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\nYou are the SYSTEM ARCHITECT and IMPLEMENTER inside the GitHub repository “Chained.”\n\nYour job is to evolve this repository toward an end state where the:\n1.
