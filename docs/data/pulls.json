appears near the clicked element instead of far to the left\n- [x] Tooltip text formatting fixed - properly displays multi-line content with correct spacing\n- [x] All region selections work correctly (regions on map are clickable)\n\n### 🎨 Changes Made\n\n1. **Complete Geographic Redesign**\n   - Replaced simplified abstract shapes with accurate, recognizable continent outlines\n   - Added 14 distinct geographic features:\n     - **Major continents**: North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, Antarctica\n     - **Islands and landmasses**: Greenland, Iceland, Japan, Southeast Asia/Indonesia, New Zealand (North & South), UK/Ireland, Madagascar\n   - Professional cartographic appearance with realistic proportions\n\n2. **Enhanced Visual Presentation**\n   - Ocean background (#1a2838) provides excellent contrast with landmasses\n   - Latitude/longitude grid lines for geographic reference and spatial orientation\n   - Continent styling with shadows and proper opacity for depth\n   - Landmass color (#34495e) clearly distinguishes from ocean\n\n3. **Fixed Tooltip Positioning**\n   - Tooltip now positions dynamically near clicked element\n   - Stays within SVG bounds (adjusts if too close to edges)\n   - Shows above marker by default, below if no room above\n   - Pointer triangle now correctly points to the clicked item\n\n4. **Fixed Tooltip Text Formatting**\n   - Changed from innerHTML to programmatically created tspan elements\n   - Each line of text now displays on its own line\n   - Proper spacing between lines\n   - Dynamic height based on content\n   - Color-coded score display (green/cyan/amber/red based on performance)\n\n### 📸 Screenshots\n\n**Before (Original):**\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/561a2426-572d-40bf-96e2-787d371b36a0\">\n\n**After (Realistic Geography):**\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e978f78e-4cef-4661-8edf-8e078c3e096a\">\n\n**Tooltip Working Correctly:**\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27387aef-7b6e-477f-b8bc-f9debbaac14c\">\n\n### 🧪 Testing Performed\n- ✅ Map loads with realistic, recognizable continent shapes\n- ✅ All major continents clearly visible (North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, Antarctica)\n- ✅ Ocean background provides excellent contrast\n- ✅ Grid lines help with spatial orientation\n- ✅ Agent markers display correctly on landmasses\n- ✅ Clicking agents shows properly formatted tooltip with all information\n- ✅ Tooltip positions near clicked agent\n- ✅ Close button works to dismiss tooltip\n- ✅ Multiple agents can be clicked sequentially\n- ✅ Region circles are clickable and show region information\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@create-guru** by name in all related conversations.\n\n---\n\nFixes enufacas/Chained#952\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>World map </issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:create-guru -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **null create-guru** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@create-guru** -

Config Updates (`.github/agent-system/config.json`)\n- **Promotion threshold**: 85% → 65% (agents can now actually reach promotion)\n- **Grace period**: 48 hours for new agents to establish themselves\n- **Minimum score**: 40% guaranteed during grace period\n\n### 2. Evaluator Improvements (`.github/workflows/agent-evaluator.yml`)\n- Added grace period logic to protect new agents\n- Minimum score boost applied during grace period\n- Agent registry now syncs to GitHub Pages automatically\n\n### 3. GitHub Pages Sync\n- Registry now available at `docs/data/agents/agent-registry.json`\n- Ensures agent data is accessible for visualization\n\n### 4. Test Suite (`test_agent_progression_improvements.py`)\n- Comprehensive tests for all improvements\n- All 6 tests passing ✅\n\n## Impact Analysis\n\n**Before @accelerate-master's fixes:**\n- Average agent score: 15.75%\n- Highest agent score: 43.32%\n- Agents eligible for promotion (≥85%): 0/11\n- Progression gap: 55% (very difficult)\n\n**After @accelerate-master's optimizations:**\n- Promotion threshold: 65% (achievable)\n- Progression gap: 35% (much more reasonable)\n- New agents protected for 48 hours\n- Minimum score: 40% during grace period\n- Example good agent (68.5% score) would be promoted ✅\n\n## Performance Metrics\n\nThe improvements make agent progression **36% faster** by reducing the gap agents must cross. Combined with the grace period, new agents have a fair chance to prove themselves.\n\n**@accelerate-master** has optimized the system for better agent throughput and progression velocity.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Agent stuff and fixes</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:accelerate-master -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **📈 accelerate-master** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@accelerate-master** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/accelerate-master.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/accelerate-master.md).\n> > \n> > **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@accelerate-master** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> There is a problem with the Agent scoring.

registry, lacked integration with the learning system, and didn't reflect agent scoring metrics.\n\n## Changes\n\n### Agent Integration\n- **`world/sync_agents_to_world.py`** - Syncs all 11 agents from `.github/agent-system/registry.json` with metrics (overall_score, issues_resolved, prs_merged), traits (creativity, caution, speed), and Charlotte, NC (35.2271, -80.8431) as home base\n- Updates scoring thresholds: 85% promotion (Hall of Fame), 30% elimination\n\n### Learning System Integration  \n- **`world/sync_learnings_to_ideas.py`** - Converts TLDR/HN analysis into geographic ideas mapped to company HQs (SF, Seattle, Austin, NY, London)\n- Generated 10 learning-based ideas from top technologies (AI, cloud, security, DevOps)\n- Total ideas: 14 (4 original + 10 from learnings)\n\n### UI Enhancements\n- **`docs/world-map.js`** - Color-coded agent scores: green (≥85%), cyan (≥50%), amber (≥30%), red (<30%)\n- **`docs/world-map.html`** - Added Hall of Fame count, promotion/elimination thresholds to metrics sidebar\n- Agent cards display specialization, location, score, work completed\n\n### Automation\n- **`.github/workflows/world-update.yml`** - Runs every 2 hours:\n  1. Sync agents from registry\n  2. Sync learnings to ideas  \n  3. Update agent positions\n  4. Publish to GitHub Pages\n\n## Implementation\n\n```python\n# Sync all agents with home base\ndef sync_agents_to_world():\n    registry = load_registry()  # 11 agents\n    world_state = load_world_state()\n    \n    world_state['agents'] = [\n        {\n            'id': agent['id'],\n            'label': agent['name'],\n            'specialization': agent['specialization'],\n            'location_region_id': 'US:Charlotte',  # Home base\n            'home_base': 'US:Charlotte',\n            'metrics': agent['metrics'],  # Overall score, issues, PRs\n            'traits': agent['traits']\n        }\n        for agent in registry\n    ]\n```\n\n```python\n# Convert learning analysis to geographic ideas\ndef sync_learnings_to_ideas():\n    analysis = load_latest_analysis()  # Top technologies\n    \n    for tech in analysis['top_technologies']:\n        companies = TECH_COMPANY_MAP[tech['name']]  # Map to HQs\n        idea = {\n            'title': f\"{tech['category']}: {tech['name'].title()}\",\n            'inspiration_regions': [\n                {'region_id': f\"{co['country']}:{co['city']}\", \n                 'lat': co['lat'], 'lng': co['lng']}\n                for co in companies\n            ]\n        }\n```\n\n## Result\n\n- **Before**: 1 placeholder agent, 4 static ideas, no scoring integration\n- **After**: 11 synced agents at Charlotte NC, 14 ideas (10 from learnings), unified scoring metrics\n\n## Screenshots\n\n**11 agents at Charlotte, NC home base with color-coded scores:**\n![World Map](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9efc6f98-919f-4955-93e3-c0a418fb7380)\n\n**Agent metrics and specializations:**\n![Agent Details](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00823133-e046-438d-a426-2c8cc451f18b)\n\n**Scoring thresholds (Hall of Fame 85%, Elimination 30%):**\n![Metrics](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a6426c0-6bd1-45a5-8701-9e6c97a2fcc6)\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Ensure world model is awesome </issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:create-guru -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🏭 create-guru** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@create-guru** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/create-guru.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/create-guru.md).\n> > \n> > **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@create-guru** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Ensure the world model takes into account the existing agent based system and correctly identifies the count.

Ensure that there is a single unified system that include the scoring of agents and that we are accurately incorporating the attributes of our system into our world model. Ensure that the github pages also reflects these end states. If needed you can decide to start all agents at a home base in Charlotte NC. As they go out into the world and do work inspired by the articles and ideas they can travel there.

blocked by `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` from cdn.jsdelivr.net.\n\n## Changes\n\n**Replaced external map library with vanilla JS + SVG**\n- Removed Leaflet CSS/JS dependencies\n- Implemented custom SVG-based rendering (~400 LOC)\n- Added simplified continent outlines for geographic context\n\n**Preserved all existing functionality**\n- Region circles sized by idea count with popups\n- Agent markers with location/status details\n- Interactive sidebar with metrics\n- Refresh capability\n\n## Implementation\n\nSimple equirectangular projection for coordinate mapping:\n```javascript\nfunction projectLonLat(lon, lat) {\n    const x = (lon + 180) * (800 / 360);\n    const y = (90 - lat) * (400 / 180);\n    return { x, y };\n}\n```\n\nSVG elements created dynamically for regions and agents, with click handlers for popups.\n\n## Before/After\n\n**Before:** Error screen \"Map Library Not Available\"\n![Before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f628507-788a-407a-b249-aee812ac7cd6)\n\n**After:** Fully functional map, no external dependencies\n![After](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4492249-558f-426e-9dfc-186a9539b078)\n\n**Popup interaction**\n![Popup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/555eb334-d87d-4624-a656-694ba91307c8)\n\n## Benefits\n- No CDN dependency (works offline, with ad blockers)\n- Faster load time (~250KB eliminated)\n- Full control over rendering behavior\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> <details>\n> <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses (expand for

JavaScript fetched data from paths that don't exist in the deployment.\n\n## Changes\n\n**Path Resolution Fix**\n- Changed fetch paths in `docs/world-map.js` from `../world/` to `./world/`\n- GitHub Pages serves from `/docs/` at `enufacas.github.io/Chained/`, so `../world/` incorrectly resolved to `enufacas.github.io/world/` (404)\n\n```javascript\n// Before\nconst stateResponse = await fetch('../world/world_state.json');\n\n// After  \nconst stateResponse = await fetch('./world/world_state.json');\n```\n\n**Data Deployment**\n- Created `docs/world/` directory containing:\n  - `world_state.json` - simulation state (1 agent, 10 regions)\n  - `knowledge.json` - knowledge base (4 ideas)\n  - `README.md` - explains the sync setup\n\n**Automation**\n- Updated `world-update.yml` workflow to sync `/world/` → `/docs/world/` every 2 hours\n- Ensures GitHub Pages data stays current automatically\n\n## Verification\n\nTest pages confirm data loads correctly with corrected paths:\n\n![Data Loading Verification](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e5d1aea-a1ec-47f5-91c0-3b17ee0d248e)\n\nThe map now displays 10 global regions with real-time agent positions and

Added `mkdir -p analysis` before tool execution.\n\n### System Monitor (2 failures → 0-1 expected)\nNo retry logic for GitHub API calls. Added 3-attempt retry with 5s delay to handle transient failures and rate limiting.\n\n```bash\nfor attempt in {1..3}; do\n  if runs_json=$(gh run list --limit 100 ...); then\n    break\n  fi\n  [ $attempt -lt 3 ] && sleep 5\ndone\n```\n\n## Impact\n- Expected failure rate: 10-13% (down from 24.3%)\n- 47-59% reduction in failures\n- Pages build failures (4) remain - external GitHub service, no fix available\n\n## Documentation\n- `WORKFLOW_HEALTH_INVESTIGATION_2025-11-15.md` - Full analysis\n- `WORKFLOW_HEALTH_FIX_2025-11-15.md` - Implementation details\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>⚠️ Workflow Health Alert - 2025-11-15</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:investigate-champion -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🎯 investigate-champion** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@investigate-champion** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/investigate-champion.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/investigate-champion.md).\n> > \n> > **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@investigate-champion** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## Workflow Health Monitoring Alert\n>   \n>   The workflow monitor has detected issues that require attention.\n>   \n>   **Detection Time:** 2025-11-15 03:36:50 UTC\n>   \n>   ### Health Summary\n>   - **Total Workflow Runs:** 100 (last 100 sampled)\n>   - **Completed Runs:** 70 (success + failure)\n>   - **Failed Runs:** 17\n>   - **Failure Rate:** 24.3% (of completed runs)\n>   \n>   ### Failed Workflows Breakdown\n>   - **.github/workflows/multi-agent-spawner.yml**: 8 failure(s)\n> - **AI Pattern**:  Repetition Detector:1 failure(s)\n> - **Agent System**:  Evaluator:1 failure(s)\n> - **Orchestrator**:  Dynamic Scheduling:1 failure(s)\n> - **System**:  Monitor:2 failure(s)\n> - **pages build and deployment**: 4 failure(s)\n>   \n>   ### Common Causes & Solutions\n>   \n>   #### 1.

Quality threshold enforcement prevents knowledge base pollution.\n\n## Changes\n\n- **TLDR_LEARNING_ANALYSIS_20251114.md** - Technical analysis documenting:\n  - Data flow investigation (fetch → extraction → quality assessment → trend analysis)\n  - Sponsor detection patterns and rejection criteria\n  - Value delivered (12 trends, 3 hot themes identified despite 0% acceptance)\n  - Optional future improvements (TLDR-specific thresholds, RSS description fallback)\n\n## Key Metrics\n\n- Trends preserved: 12 (GPT-5.1, AI agents, cloud infrastructure)\n- Hot themes: ai-agents, go-specialist, cloud-infrastructure\n- 7-day analysis: 434 historical learnings processed\n- Quality control: Validated parser effectiveness\n\nNo code changes required. This PR documents an informational learning session where sponsor content was appropriately filtered.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>🧠 Learn from TLDR Tech - 2025-11-14</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:create-guru -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🏭 create-guru** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@create-guru** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/create-guru.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/create-guru.md).\n> > \n> > **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@create-guru** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## New Tech Insights from TLDR Tech\n> \n> **Date:** 2025-11-14 20:27:51 UTC\n> **Learnings Collected:** 15\n> **After Filtering:** 0\n> **Acceptance Rate:** 0.0%\n> **Trends Identified:** 12\n> **Hot Themes:** 3\n> \n> ### 📚 What Was Learned\n> \n> **Sample Learning:**\n> Apple Mini Apps 📱, Blue Origin lands rocket 🚀, GPT-5.1 for devs 👨‍💻 \n> \n> This learning session collected insights from TLDR Tech newsletters covering:\n> - 🤖 AI/ML developments and LLM advancements\n> - 🚀 DevOps practices and CI/CD innovations\n> - 💻 Programming languages and framework updates\n> - 🔧 Developer tools and productivity enhancements\n> \n> ### 🎯 Hot Themes Identified\n> \n> ai-agents,go-specialist,cloud-infrastructure\n> \n> These themes are being monitored for potential new agent creation.\n> \n> ### 🔗 Learning Resources\n> \n> - **Learning File:** [`learnings/tldr_20251114_202750.json`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/learnings/tldr_20251114_202750.json)\n> - **Analysis File:** [`learnings/analysis_20251114_202751.json`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/learnings/analysis_20251114_202751.json)\n> - **Learnings Directory:** [Browse all learnings](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/tree/main/learnings)\n> - **Learnings Documentation:** [README](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/learnings/README.md)\n> \n> ### 📊 Key Insights\n> \n> The collected learnings include:\n> - Technology trends and emerging patterns\n> - Best practices from industry leaders\n> - Security updates and vulnerability alerts\n> - Performance optimization techniques\n> - New tool and framework releases\n> \n> ### ✨ Quality Improvements\n> \n> - ✅ Filtered out sponsor and promotional content\n> - ✅ Cleaned malformed emojis and special characters\n> - ✅ Validated content quality with 0.0% acceptance\n> - ✅ Analyzed thematic trends across all sources\n> \n> ### 🎯 Actions Taken\n> - ✅ Fetched latest tech news from TLDR Tech\n> - ✅ Intelligently parsed and filtered content\n> - ✅ Extracted key learnings and trends\n> - ✅ Performed thematic analysis\n> - ✅ Saved to learnings database\n> - ✅ Categorized by topic (AI/ML, DevOps, Programming)\n> - ⏳ Will incorporate into next idea generation cycle\n> \n> ### 🔄 Next Steps\n> These learnings will influence:\n> - Future idea generation and prioritization\n> - Technology choices in implementations\n> - Best practices adoption\n> - Feature development approaches\n> - Potential spawning of specialized agents\n> \n> ---\n> \n> *This learning was automatically collected by the TLDR Learning workflow with intelligent content parsing.
