Created placeholder PRs with markdown files, not real implementations\n- `copilot-assign.yml` - Only added labels, didn't actually assign to Copilot\n\n**What Remains:**\n- `copilot-graphql-assign.yml` -

Updated `.github/workflows/auto-review-merge.yml`\n- Added check for repository owner authentication\n- Added check for trusted bots (github-actions[bot], dependabot[bot], copilot)\n- Modified auto-merge logic to only approve PRs that are:\n  - From repository owner AND have `copilot` label, OR\n  - From trusted bots AND have `copilot` label\n- Added informative comment on PRs that don't meet auto-merge criteria\n- Provides clear feedback on why a PR wasn't auto-merged\n\n#### 2. Created `.github/CODEOWNERS`\n- Requires @enufacas to review all changes by default\n- Prevents external contributions from being merged without owner review\n- Works in conjunction with branch protection rules\n\n#### 3. Updated `CONFIGURATION.md`\n- Updated branch protection settings to reflect new security model\n- Added instructions for enabling \"Allow specified actors to bypass required pull requests\"\n- Added security considerations section explaining the protection mechanism\n- Clarified that owner/Copilot PRs can still auto-merge\n\n#### 4. Added `docs/SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md`\n- Comprehensive documentation of the security model\n- Authorization matrix showing all scenarios\n- Attack mitigation strategies\n- Testing results (all 11 test cases pass ✅)\n- Troubleshooting guide\n- Maintenance instructions\n\n#### 5. Updated `README.md`\n- Added contributing section explaining external contribution process\n- Clarified that external PRs require manual review\n- Referenced security documentation\n\n### How It Works\n\n**For Owner/Copilot PRs (Autonomous):**\n- PRs created by @enufacas with `copilot` label → Auto-merge ✅\n- PRs created by github-actions[bot] with `copilot` label → Auto-merge ✅\n\n**For External PRs (Manual Review):**\n- Any PR from external contributors → Manual review required ⚠️\n- Clear comment added explaining why auto-merge was skipped\n- Owner must manually review and approve\n\n### Security Testing\n\nAll test cases pass:\n- ✅ Owner PR with copilot label → Auto-merges\n- ✅ github-actions[bot] PR with copilot label → Auto-merges\n- ✅ dependabot[bot] PR with copilot label → Auto-merges\n- ✅ copilot bot PR with copilot label → Auto-merges\n- ✅ External user PR with copilot label → Requires manual review\n- ✅ External user PR without label → Requires manual review\n- ✅ Owner PR without copilot label → Requires manual review\n- ✅ Bot PR without copilot label → Requires manual review\n- ✅ Random bot PR → Requires manual review\n- ✅ Attacker bot PR → Requires manual review\n- ✅ User with \"copilot\" in name → Requires manual review\n\n### Benefits\n\n1. 🔒 **Security**: External contributions cannot bypass owner review\n2. 🤖 **Autonomy**: Copilot workflows continue operating independently\n3. 📝 **Transparency**: Clear feedback on why PRs aren't auto-merged\n4. 🎯 **Flexibility**: Owner maintains full control\n5. 📊 **Auditability**: All decisions logged in workflow runs\n\nThis ensures the perpetual AI motion machine continues to work autonomously while preventing unauthorized external contributions from bypassing review.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> This is a public repo do how can i stop outside contributions from being merged without my review.
