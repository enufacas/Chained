Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n>   **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n>   \n>   #### 3. Missing Secrets\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n>   **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n>   \n>   #### 4. External Dependencies\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n>   **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n>   \n>   #### 5. Configuration Issues\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n>   **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n>   \n>   ### Recommended Actions\n>   1. **First:** Check if label-related (see Quick Fix above)\n>   2. Review the failed workflows breakdown above\n>   3. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs\n>   4. Focus on workflows with multiple failures first\n>   5.
