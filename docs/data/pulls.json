However, there was no enforcement mechanism ensuring Copilot actually uses the assigned agent identity when executing tasks.\n\n## Changes\n\n### 1. Repository-wide enforcement (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)\n- Upgraded agent mention rule to `CRITICAL REQUIREMENT` status\n- Added explicit runner execution requirements: Copilot must read issue body to extract assigned `@agent-name` and use it throughout all work\n\n### 2. Path-specific instructions (`.github/instructions/`)\nLeverages GitHub's official `applyTo:` mechanism for context-aware enforcement:\n\n- **`agent-mentions.instructions.md`** → workflows, scripts, agent tooling\n- **`workflow-agent-assignment.instructions.md`** → Copilot/agent workflows  \n- **`issue-pr-agent-mentions.instructions.md`** → issue/PR templates\n\nEach file includes detailed runner execution guidance with correct/incorrect examples.\n\n### 3. Workflow automation enhancement (`tools/assign-copilot-to-issue.sh`)\n- Issue body directive: `**@$matched_agent** - Please use...`\n- Assignment comments: `**@$matched_agent** will analyze...`\n- Action lists: Prefix each step with `**@$matched_agent**`\n- Added: `IMPORTANT: Always mention **@$matched_agent** by name` reminders\n\n### 4. Documentation (`summaries/AGENT_MENTION_ENFORCEMENT.md`)\nComplete system architecture with \"Critical: Runner Execution Context\" section explaining why this is the primary enforcement point.\n\n## Example Flow\n\nIssue created → Agent matched (`@secure-specialist`) → Issue body updated:\n\n```markdown\n**@secure-specialist** - Please use the specialized approach...\n**IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@secure-specialist** by name in all conversations.\n```\n\nCopilot executes in runner → Reads issue → Extracts `@secure-specialist` → Creates PR:\n\n```markdown\nTitle: fix: add auth validation (@secure-specialist)\n\n**@secure-specialist** has fixed the authentication vulnerability.\n\nCommits:\n- fix: add validation per @secure-specialist  \n- test: add security tests per @secure-specialist approach\n```\n\nThis enables proper attribution for agent performance metrics and maintains system transparency.\n\n## Key Insight\n\nThe critical enforcement point is **runner execution**: when Copilot reads the issue body to identify its assigned agent identity and uses that `@agent-name` consistently in all outputs. The four-layer system (repository-wide + path-specific + workflow + docs) ensures this happens reliably.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> Update our repository agent rules so that the custom agent that is mentioned in the issue is then always mentioned by name in the conversation that the copilot workflow creates\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 We'd love your input!

Look at recent repo activity (Issues + PRs) from the last 2 hours.\n2. Turn that activity into a small “episode” JSON file describing a story with scenes and characters.\n3. Save that episode JSON into docs/episodes/.\n4. Ensure docs/tv.html can load the latest episode JSON and render it as animated panels using HTML/CSS/JS only (no video).\n\nI want you to generate:\n1) A GitHub Actions workflow in .github/workflows/chained_tv.yml\n2) A Python script in scripts/generate_episode.py\n3) An HTML viewer in docs/tv.html\n\n### 1) Workflow requirements (.github/workflows/chained_tv.yml)\n\n- Name: “Chained TV Episode Generator”\n- Trigger: schedule every 2 hours, plus manual workflow_dispatch.\n  - cron example: \"0 */2 * * *\"\n- Jobs:\n  - runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n  - Steps:\n    - checkout the repo\n    - set up Python (3.12 is fine)\n    - install dependencies (use requirements.txt if needed, otherwise inline with pip install requests)\n    - run the Python script scripts/generate_episode.py\n      - pass GITHUB_TOKEN via env so the script can call the GitHub API\n    - if the script modified docs/episodes/, commit and push changes back to the default branch\n      - git user.name \"chained-bot\"\n      - git user.email \"chained-bot@example.com\"\n      - commit message like \"chore: new chained tv episode\"\n      - don’t fail if there’s nothing new to commit\n\n### 2) Episode generator script (scripts/generate_episode.py)\n\nLanguage: Python 3.\n\nBehavior:\n- Use the GitHub REST API with the token from env var GITHUB_TOKEN.\n- Identify repo owner + name from env (e.g. GITHUB_REPOSITORY = \"owner/repo\").\n- Determine a “since” timestamp = now minus 2 hours (in ISO format).\n- Fetch:\n  - Issues updated since that timestamp\n  - Pull requests updated since that timestamp\n- Basic data to pull:\n  - For issues: number, title, state, user.login, labels, html_url\n  - For PRs: number, title, state, user.login, merged or not, additions/deletions, html_url\n- If there’s no activity in the last 2 hours, the script can either:\n  - skip generating an episode, OR\n  - generate a small “filler” / “quiet repo” episode.\n\nEpisode JSON format:\nSave a JSON object with this shape:\n\n{\n  \"date\": \"<ISO timestamp for this episode>\",\n  \"title\": \"<short witty title based on recent activity>\",\n  \"scenes\": [\n    {\n      \"bg\": \"night\" | \"alert\" | \"calm\" | \"lab\",        // simple background theme string\n      \"narration\": \"<1-2 sentences narrating this moment>\",\n      \"characters\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"<character name, e.g. agent or developer or CI>\",\n          \"side\": \"left\" | \"right\" | \"center\",\n          \"mood\": \"determined\" | \"smug\" | \"angry\" | \"worried\" | \"happy\",\n          \"line\": \"<dialogue line for this character>\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nStory logic (doesn’t need to be perfect, just fun and deterministic-ish):\n- If there are merged PRs:\n  - Make a scene where a “Build Guardian” or “Merge Oracle” announces the success.\n- If there are failing PRs or closed unmerged PRs:\n  - Make a scene about rivalry or failure.\n- If multiple authors are involved:\n  - Map authors to “characters” and let them have competing or cooperative lines.\n- Optionally, create one intro scene summarizing the time window.\n- Optionally, cap it to 3–6 scenes per episode so it doesn’t blow up.\n\nFile output:\n- Make sure docs/episodes/ exists (create if needed).\n- Always write a “latest.json” file to docs/episodes/latest.json.\n- Also write a timestamped file like docs/episodes/episode-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.json\n- Pretty-print the JSON with indentation.\n\n### 3) HTML viewer (docs/tv.html)\n\nCreate a single-page HTML file that:\n- Has a simple dark-themed layout.\n- Loads docs/episodes/latest.json (relative path: \"./episodes/latest.json\") with fetch().\n- Displays:\n  - episode.title at the top\n  - episode.date underneath\n- For each scene in episode.scenes:\n  - Render a panel/div with:\n    - a background style based on scene.bg\n      - e.g. .bg-night, .bg-alert, .bg-calm, .bg-lab\n    - a narration text at the top of the panel\n    - characters displayed as “slots” across the panel:\n      - character container aligned left/right/center based on character.side\n      - an avatar placeholder (just a colored box or circle using CSS, no images needed)\n      - character name\n      - a speech bubble div containing character.line\n- Add simple animations:\n  - Scenes should fade/slide in one after another every few seconds.\n  - Speech bubbles can have a small “pop” animation when they appear.\n- Only use vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks).\n- No external libraries; fully static so it works on GitHub Pages.\n- If fetch() fails or there’s no episode, show a “No episode yet” message.\n\nStyling:\n- Use CSS in a <style> tag in the head.\n- Try to make it look like a sci-fi dashboard / anime story panel:\n  - rounded corners\n  - soft glows around avatars\n  - subtle gradients for backgrounds\n\nJavaScript...\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n✨ Let Copilot coding agent [set things up for you](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/new?title=✨+Set+up+Copilot+instructions&body=Configure%20instructions%20for%20this%20repository%20as%20documented%20in%20%5BBest%20practices%20for%20Copilot%20coding%20agent%20in%20your%20repository%5D%28https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips%29%2E%0A%0A%3COnboard%20this%20repo%3E&assignees=copilot) — coding agent works faster and does higher quality work when set up for your repo.\n","closedAt":"2025-11-13T05:38:47Z","createdAt":"2025-11-13T05:23:17Z","mergedAt":"2025-11-13T05:38:47Z","number":591,"state":"MERGED","title":"Add automated \"Chained TV\" episode generator from repository activity","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/pull/591"},{"author":{"is_bot":true,"login":"app/copilot-swe-agent"},"body":"Implements a code translator between programming paradigms (OOP, Functional, Imperative, Declarative, Procedural) to enable dynamic code pattern adaptation in the autonomous system.\n\n## Implementation\n\n- **ParadigmTranslator class** with strategy pattern for 6 bidirectional transformations\n- **AST-based paradigm detection** analyzing node types and patterns\n- **Regex transformation engine** for code structure manipulation\n- **TranslationResult dataclass** tracking applied transformations and warnings\n\n## Supported Transformations\n\n- **Imperative ↔ Declarative**: Loops to/from comprehensions, filter patterns\n- **OOP ↔ Functional**: Class methods to/from pure functions, map/filter patterns\n- **Procedural ↔ OOP**: Function groups to/from encapsulated classes\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```python\nfrom paradigm_translator import ParadigmTranslator, Paradigm\n\ntranslator = ParadigmTranslator()\n\n# Imperative loop\ncode = \"\"\"\nevens = []\nfor n in numbers:\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        evens.append(n)\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = translator.translate(code, Paradigm.IMPERATIVE, Paradigm.DECLARATIVE)\n# Output: evens = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n17 test cases covering all transformation pairs, paradigm detection, and error handling.
