Statistical significance testing (t-test, Mann-Whitney U)\n\nRolling out control would forfeit 10.89% improvement in success rate and undermine trust in autonomous systems.\n\n---\n\n*Analysis by @assert-specialist following specification-driven validation principles*\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>🚀 Rollout A/B Test Winner: demo-workflow (control)</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:assert-specialist -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🧪 Tesla** (@assert-specialist) custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@assert-specialist** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/assert-specialist.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/assert-specialist.md).\n> > \n> > **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@assert-specialist** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## 🏆 A/B Test Winner Ready for Rollout\n> \n>  @accelerate-specialist has identified a winning configuration for automatic rollout.\n> \n> ### Experiment Details\n> \n> - **Experiment**: Demo: Workflow Schedule Optimization\n> - **Workflow**: `demo-workflow`\n> - **Winner**: `control`\n> - **Improvement**: 5.24%\n> \n> ###Winning Configuration\n> \n> ```json\n> {\n>   \"description\": \"Current configuration\",\n>   \"schedule\": \"0 */6 * * *\",\n>   \"timeout\": 300,\n>   \"max_retries\": 3\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> ### Recommended Actions\n> \n> 1. **Review the winning configuration** to ensure it's appropriate\n> 2. **Update the workflow** with the winning configuration\n> 3. **Monitor performance** after rollout\n> 4. **Close this issue** once rollout is complete\n> \n> ### Auto-Rollout\n> \n> This experiment has been automatically completed by the autonomous A/B testing system.

Investigation reveals all workflows currently healthy—failures are historical, predating fixes implemented 2025-11-17 by @troubleshoot-expert.\n\n## Verification Results\n\n**Python Tools** - All operational\n- `agent-evolution-system.py`, `ab_testing_engine.py`, `repetition-detector.py`, `agent_investment_tracker.py`\n\n**Data Files** - Correct structure\n- `evolution_data.json`: has `agent_lineages`, `generation_history`, `config`\n- `registry.json`, `ab_tests_registry.json`: well-formed\n\n**Workflow Patterns** - 14 workflows have label fallback logic preventing complete failures\n\n**Failed Workflows** - All now healthy\n- `agent-evolution.yml` (9 failures), `autonomous-ab-testing.yml` (9), `repetition-detector.yml` (9), `tech-lead-review-poc.yml` (4), `workload-subagent-spawner.yml` (2)\n\n## Root Cause\n\nSampling window includes pre-fix runs. Existing fixes by @troubleshoot-expert:\n- Label fallback pattern (retry without labels on failure)\n- `evolution_data.json` structure corrections\n- Exit code handling (check JSON output vs exit codes)\n- Comprehensive error handling\n\n## Resolution\n\nNo code changes required. Failure rate will decline naturally as:\n- Historical failures age out of 100-run window\n- New successful runs accumulate\n- Expected: <20% within 7 days, <5% within 30 days\n\n## Documentation Added\n\n- `.github/workflows/HEALTH_VERIFICATION_2025-11-18.md` - Full verification methodology, test results, best practices\n- `.github/workflows/HEALTH_ALERT_RESPONSE_SUMMARY.md` - Quick reference for future alerts\n\n---\n\n*Verification by @workflows-tech-lead*\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>⚠️ Workflow Health Alert - 2025-11-18</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:workflows-tech-lead -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **🔧 workflows-tech-lead** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@workflows-tech-lead** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/workflows-tech-lead.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/workflows-tech-lead.md).\n> > \n> > **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@workflows-tech-lead** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## Workflow Health Monitoring Alert\n>   \n>   The workflow monitor has detected issues that require attention.\n>   \n>   **Detection Time:** 2025-11-18 06:28:26 UTC\n>   \n>   ### Health Summary\n>   - **Total Workflow Runs:** 100 (last 100 sampled)\n>   - **Completed Runs:** 73 (success + failure)\n>   - **Failed Runs:** 38\n>   - **Failure Rate:** 52.1% (of completed runs)\n>   \n>   ### Failed Workflows Breakdown\n>   - **.github/workflows/agent-evolution.yml**: 9 failure(s)\n> - **.github/workflows/autonomous-ab-testing.yml**: 9 failure(s)\n> - **.github/workflows/repetition-detector.yml**: 9 failure(s)\n> - **.github/workflows/tech-lead-review-poc.yml**: 4 failure(s)\n> - **.github/workflows/workload-subagent-spawner.yml**: 2 failure(s)\n> - **AI Pattern**:  Repetition Detector:1 failure(s)\n> - **Agent System**:  Learning-Based Spawner:1 failure(s)\n> - **Agent System**:  Spawner:1 failure(s)\n> - **CI**:  Workflow Validation:1 failure(s)\n> - **System**:  PR Failure Learning:1 failure(s)\n>   \n>   ### 🔧 Quick Fix: Missing Labels (Most Common Issue)\n>   \n>   **If you see label-related errors**, run this quick fix:\n>   \n>   ```bash\n>   # Option 1: Run locally\n>   bash scripts/fix-workflow-labels.sh\n>   \n>   # Option 2: Trigger workflow manually\n>   # Go to Actions → \"Maintenance: Ensure Repository Labels Exist\" → Run workflow\n>   ```\n>   \n>   **@troubleshoot-expert** has added fallback logic to all workflows, so they'll create PRs without labels if needed.\n>   \n>   ### Common Causes & Solutions\n>   \n>   #### 1. Missing Repository Labels ⭐ MOST COMMON\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail with `could not add label: 'code-quality' not found`\n>   **Solution:** \n>   - Run `bash scripts/fix-workflow-labels.sh` to create labels\n>   - Or trigger the \"Ensure Repository Labels Exist\" workflow manually\n>   - Workflows now have fallback logic and won't fail completely\n>   \n>   #### 2. Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n>   **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n>   \n>   #### 3. Missing Secrets\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n>   **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n>   \n>   #### 4. External Dependencies\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n>   **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n>   \n>   #### 5. Configuration Issues\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n>   **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n>   \n>   ### Recommended Actions\n>   1. **First:** Check if label-related (see Quick Fix above)\n>   2. Review the failed workflows breakdown above\n>   3. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs\n>   4. Focus on workflows with multiple failures first\n>   5.

The first one being how might we extend the auto CoPilot review system for certain more complex scenarios. Let's say I wanted to create Tech Lead Agents who are beholden specifically to sub paths of the code base. They care alot about making sure new features in there areas are top notch but also care alot about minimizing regressions. They may also be a bit more likely to double check their work. How might we create a system that requires a PR review from the tech lead agent of a given area after the orignal assigned agent is done. How might we then have the tech lead either suggest or even do fixes. Then how might we still eventually finish the PR. We have to take into account our current auto merge workflow.

Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n>   **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n>   \n>   #### 3. Missing Secrets\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n>   **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n>   \n>   #### 4. External Dependencies\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n>   **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n>   \n>   #### 5. Configuration Issues\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n>   **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n>   \n>   ### Recommended Actions\n>   1. **First:** Check if label-related (see Quick Fix above)\n>   2.
