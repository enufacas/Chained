Missing Repository Labels ⭐ MOST COMMON\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail with `could not add label: 'code-quality' not found`\n>   **Solution:** \n>   - Run `bash scripts/fix-workflow-labels.sh` to create labels\n>   - Or trigger the \"Ensure Repository Labels Exist\" workflow manually\n>   - Workflows now have fallback logic and won't fail completely\n>   \n>   #### 2. Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n>   **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n>   \n>   #### 3. Missing Secrets\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n>   **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n>   \n>   #### 4. External Dependencies\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n>   **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n>   \n>   #### 5. Configuration Issues\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n>   **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n>   \n>   ### Recommended Actions\n>   1. **First:** Check if label-related (see Quick Fix above)\n>   2.

Discovered branch names were already in metadata but not displayed.\n\n## Analysis Documents\n\n- **`docs/AGENTOPS_ENHANCEMENT_ANALYSIS.md`**: Full technical analysis\n  - Cost breakdown for Jobs API (~3,600 calls/day, 7.2% rate limit)\n  - Cost breakdown for Logs API (expensive: bandwidth + parsing overhead)\n  - Phased implementation roadmap\n  \n- **`docs/AGENTOPS_DATA_EXTRACTION_SUMMARY.md`**: Q&A format summary\n  - Three-tier data classification (free/low-cost/expensive)\n  - Cost comparison matrices\n  - ROI analysis\n\n## Implementation (Phase 1)\n\nAdded branch name display and filtering to `docs/agentops.html` at zero API cost:\n\n```javascript\n// Uses existing head_branch field from workflow run metadata\ncolumns: [\n  { key: 'agent', label: 'Agent' },\n  { key: 'branch', label: 'Branch' },  // New column\n  { key: 'status', label: 'Status' },\n  // ...\n]\n```\n\n**Branch filtering**: Dropdown dynamically populated from run data, integrates with existing filters.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n| Data Source | What It Provides | Daily API Calls | Cost Level |\n|-------------|------------------|-----------------|------------|\n| Current (Run metadata) | Branch names, PR numbers, commit SHA | 72 | Baseline |\n| Jobs API | Step-level timing, bottleneck detection | +3,600 | Low ⭐ |\n| Logs API | Error messages, stack traces | +3,600 + bandwidth | High ⚠️ |\n\n**Answer to \"how expensive\"**: Branch names and PR numbers are free (already in metadata). Jobs API adds 7.2% hourly rate limit usage - acceptable. Full log parsing is expensive - recommend on-demand only.\n\n**Next phase**: Jobs API integration for step-level performance insights (optional, cost-effective).\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> <details>\n> <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses (expand for details)</summary>\n>\n> #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules:\n>\n> - `https://api.github.com/repos/enufacas/Chained/actions/runs`\n>   - Triggering command: `python3` (http block)\n>\n> If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either:\n>\n> - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled\n> - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to the custom allowlist in this repository's [Copilot coding agent settings](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/settings/copilot/coding_agent) (admins only)\n>\n> </details>\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Enhancement</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:accelerate-master -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **📈 accelerate-master** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@accelerate-master** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/accelerate-master.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/accelerate-master.md).\n> > \n> > **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@accelerate-master** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> https://enufacas.github.io/Chained/agentops.html \n> Consider what additional data we could extract from the agent runs.

Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n>   **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n>   \n>   #### 3. Missing Secrets\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n>   **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n>   \n>   #### 4. External Dependencies\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n>   **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n>   \n>   #### 5. Configuration Issues\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n>   **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n>   \n>   ### Recommended Actions\n>   1. **First:** Check if label-related (see Quick Fix above)\n>   2. Review the failed workflows breakdown above\n>   3. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs\n>   4. Focus on workflows with multiple failures first\n>   5. Verify secrets and permissions are configured correctly\n>   6.

This causes:\n- Race conditions where branches become stale between creation and PR\n- Main branch updates while workflows are running\n- Automatic merge commits when trying to keep branches updated\n- Example: PR #1518 has merge commit `c3fb230` merging main into feature branch\n\n### Root Cause Identified ✅\n\n**The `system-monitor.yml` workflow is creating merge commits!**\n\nEvidence:\n- Merge commit `c3fb230` was created by `github-actions[bot]` on 2025-11-17 06:22:27\n- System monitor runs every 3 hours (`cron: '0 */3 * * *'`)\n- It merges `origin/main` into PR branches to \"resolve conflicts\"\n- Uses `git merge origin/main -X ours --no-edit` creating merge commits\n\nThe workflow attempts to help by keeping PRs up-to-date, but creates dirty history.\n\n### Solution Implemented ✅\n\n**Replaced `git merge` with `git rebase` in system-monitor.yml**\n\n**Changes Made:**\n1. ✅ Replaced `git merge origin/main` with `git rebase origin/main`\n2. ✅ Changed push strategy to `git push --force-with-lease` (safer than force push)\n3. ✅ Updated PR comments to reflect rebase strategy\n4. ✅ Simplified logic - removed multiple merge strategies\n5. ✅ Added clear instructions for manual conflict resolution\n6. ✅ Added @engineer-master attribution to automated comments\n\n**Benefits:**\n- **Linear History**: No more merge commits cluttering PR history\n- **Cleaner PRs**: Each PR shows only its own commits\n- **Better Diffs**: Easier to review what changed\n- **Professional Quality**: Industry standard for maintaining clean history\n- **Safe Updates**: `--force-with-lease` prevents overwriting others' work\n\n### Technical Details\n\n**Before (Merge Strategy):**\n```bash\ngit merge \"origin/${base_branch}\" -X ours --no-edit\ngit push origin \"${head_branch}\"\n```\nCreates merge commit like: `Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main' into feature-branch`\n\n**After (Rebase Strategy):**\n```bash\ngit rebase \"origin/${base_branch}\"\ngit push --force-with-lease origin \"${head_branch}\"\n```\nReplays commits on top of main, maintaining linear history\n\n### Validation ✅\n\n- [x] Analyze workflow patterns to identify high-frequency workflows\n- [x] Identify the source of merge commits (system-monitor.yml)\n- [x] Replace merge strategy with rebase in system-monitor.yml\n- [x] Validate YAML syntax is correct\n- [ ] Test the rebase approach on a sample PR\n- [ ] Monitor next automated PR updates\n- [ ] Document best practices for workflow maintainers\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Monitor the next few PRs created by automated workflows\n2. Verify no merge commits appear\n3. Check that automatic rebase works correctly\n4. Consider adding rebase guidance to other workflows\n\n### Systematic Approach\n\nFollowing **@engineer-master** principles:\n- Rigorous analysis of the problem domain ✅\n- Defensive programming to prevent future issues ✅\n- Comprehensive validation of all changes ✅\n- Clear documentation of design decisions ✅\n\n---\n\n*Tracking work on issue #1518*\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Merge commits</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:engineer-master -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **⚙️ Einstein** (@engineer-master) custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@engineer-master** -

Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n>   **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n>   \n>   #### 3. Missing Secrets\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n>   **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n>   \n>   #### 4. External Dependencies\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n>   **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n>   \n>   #### 5. Configuration Issues\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n>   **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n>   \n>   ### Recommended Actions\n>   1. **First:** Check if label-related (see Quick Fix above)\n>   2. Review the failed workflows breakdown above\n>   3. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs\n>   4. Focus on workflows with multiple failures first\n>   5.

How could we incorporate it further i wanted to consider how i might build up further context for my custom agents on demand. Wondering if these files could help. Ideally when an agent gets work I want them to first look up and around at their world state. I am aware of the potential problems with filling the context window with too much and that causing rot or hallucinations. But i was thinking that we might somehow use this index of useful information.

Workflow Triggering (HTTP 403)\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail when trying to trigger other workflows\n>   **Solution:** Remove `gh workflow run` commands; rely on scheduled triggers instead\n>   \n>   #### 3. Missing Secrets\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows requiring COPILOT_PAT fail or skip steps\n>   **Solution:** Configure required secrets in repository settings\n>   \n>   #### 4. External Dependencies\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows calling external APIs fail intermittently\n>   **Solution:** Add retry logic and graceful error handling\n>   \n>   #### 5. Configuration Issues\n>   **Symptom:** Workflows fail due to missing files or permissions\n>   **Solution:** Verify workflow configurations and file dependencies\n>   \n>   ### Recommended Actions\n>   1. **First:** Check if label-related (see Quick Fix above)\n>   2. Review the failed workflows breakdown above\n>   3. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs\n>   4. Focus on workflows with multiple failures first\n>   5.

Please produce a complete internal documentation page titled **“Data Storage & Lifecycle for Chained”** that covers:\n\n## 1. Data Storage Overview\n- Enumerate all storage locations in the repository and externally that hold data (e.g., folders like `learnings/`, `summaries/`, artifacts from workflows, external APIs, `.github/workflows/` outputs).\n- For each storage location, specify:\n  - Path (e.g., `/learnings/`, `/scripts/processed/`, GitHub Actions artifacts bucket, external database or API endpoint).\n  - Format of the stored data (e.g., JSON, CSV, Markdown logs, images, GitHub Pages HTML).\n  - Persistence vs ephemeral (for example: GitHub Actions artifacts may expire; docs under `docs/` are persistent; external API cache may be transient).\n\n## 2. Data Production Lifecycle in Chained\n- Identify and describe each data-production pathway in the repo:\n  - For example: cron workflows under `.github/workflows/idea-generator.yml` (pulling TLDR tech / Hacker News), agent-spawner workflows, tools like `tools/code-analyzer.py`, etc. (as referenced in README) 1\n- For each pathway include:\n  - Trigger: what initiates it (schedule, issue close, manual, external webhook).\n  - Input sources: e.g., tech news feeds, Hacker News, issues labels, agent performance metrics.\n  - Data transformation: what scripts/tools are used (for example `tools/pattern-matcher.py`, etc.).\n  - Output location and format: e.g., writes Markdown reports into `/summaries/`, updates `docs/`, or pushes to GitHub Pages.\n- Map them to the storage locations from section 1.\n\n## 3. Data Consumption Paths\n- Describe where and how stored data is consumed:\n  - In-repo logic: e.g., parts of the autonomous loop reference collected learnings, maybe the `learnings/` folder is used by agents.\n  - GitHub Pages: e.g., live dashboard at enufacas.github.io serves data from docs/ or from generated files. 2\n  - Visualizations/dashboards: e.g., world model map, agent leaderboard, timeline.\n  - Workflows that ingest or read stored data (for example when agents review prior learnings).\n- Link each consumption path back to its storage and production sources.\n\n## 4. End-to-End Data Flow Diagram\n- Create a high-level diagram (mermaid or PlantUML) showing:\n  - Data entering from external sources (TLDR Tech, Hacker News, issue discussions).\n  - Flow into production workflows (agent spawner, idea generator).\n  - Storage nodes (folders, artifacts, docs).\n  - Consumption nodes (dashboards, GitHub Pages, agent logic).\n- Annotate key nodes such as the loop: “Learn → Generate → Issue → Build → Merge → Learn”.\n\n## 5. Data Governance and Lifecycle Notes\n- Specify conventions the project uses (or should use) when adding new data sources, new folders or workflows.\n- Validation/verification steps: e.g., workflows under `.github/workflows` must be validated before being merged (as referenced in the README). 3\n- Artifact retention / cleanup policies: e.g., how long summaries stay, how to archive old learnings, how GitHub Pages builds refresh.\n- Risks or areas for improvement: e.g., if there are any undocumented storage locations or implicit paths, flag them and recommend logging/metadata.\n\n## 6. Format Expectations\n- Use clear headings and sub-headings.\n- Provide actual file paths and workflow names when possible (e.g., `.github/workflows/agent-spawner.yml`, `learnings/`, `docs/index.html`).\n- Do **not** assume undocumented paths—if something is unclear, note it as “to be defined” and recommend documenting it.\n- The documentation should be suitable for future contributors who want to understand **how Chained’s data flows from input → output → user facing dashboard**.\n\n---\n\n**Goal:** This document should act as the definitive “data architecture” reference for the Chained repository: where everything lives, how it’s created, how it’s used, and how everything links together.\n</issue_description>\n\n## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n\n<comments>\n</comments>\n\n\n</details>\n\n- Fixes enufacas/Chained#1454\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n✨ Let Copilot coding agent [set things up for you](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/issues/new?title=✨+Set+up+Copilot+instructions&body=Configure%20instructions%20for%20this%20repository%20as%20documented%20in%20%5BBest%20practices%20for%20Copilot%20coding%20agent%20in%20your%20repository%5D%28https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips%29%2E%0A%0A%3COnboard%20this%20repo%3E&assignees=copilot) — coding agent works faster and does higher quality work when set up for your repo.\n","closedAt":"2025-11-17T01:14:15Z","createdAt":"2025-11-17T00:40:25Z","mergedAt":"2025-11-17T01:14:15Z","number":1455,"state":"MERGED","title":"docs: add comprehensive data storage & lifecycle architecture reference (@investigate-champion)","url":"https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/pull/1455"},{"author":{"is_bot":true,"login":"app/copilot-swe-agent"},"body":"Removes the interactive tutorial page and simplifies the GitHub Pages UI by collapsing all navigation into a hamburger menu across all pages.\n\n## Changes\n\n**Deleted**\n- `docs/interactive-tutorial.html` - removed entire interactive tutorial feature\n\n**index.html**\n- Removed hero section (tagline, CTA buttons)\n- Removed inline navigation links\n- Added hamburger menu visible on all screen sizes\n\n**Navigation standardization**\n- Added hamburger menu to: `agents.html`, `ai-friends.html`, `architecture-evolution.html`, `world-map.html`, `workflow-schedule.html`, `ai-knowledge-graph.html`, `lifecycle.html`\n- Unified navigation structure and link ordering across all pages\n\n**style.css**\n- Changed hamburger button to display on desktop (removed `@media (max-width: 768px)` constraint)\n- Made navigation menu a fixed right-side slide-out panel on all devices\n- Updated `.nav-menu.active` positioning for consistent slide-out behavior\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![Hamburger menu navigation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b00e9ba6-619b-46a8-a664-13e79cf2c282)\n\nNavigation now slides out from the right with full site navigation accessible from a single hamburger button on all pages and screen sizes.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Github pages ideas</issue_title>\n> <issue_description><!-- COPILOT_AGENT:communicator-maestro -->\n> \n> > **🤖 Agent Assignment**\n> > \n> > This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot with the **📖 communicator-maestro** custom agent profile.\n> > \n> > **@communicator-maestro** - Please use the specialized approach and tools defined in [`.github/agents/communicator-maestro.md`](https://github.com/enufacas/Chained/blob/main/.github/agents/communicator-maestro.md).\n> > \n> > **IMPORTANT**: Always mention **@communicator-maestro** by name in all conversations, comments, and PRs related to this issue.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Remove this feature https://enufacas.github.io/Chained/interactive-tutorial.html\n> \n> Remove the header and collapse all navigation into the hamburger menu https://enufacas.github.io/Chained/index.html\n> \n> Ensure the same hamburger navigation is on all the github pages \n> </issue_description>\n> \n> ## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n> \n> <comments>\n> </comments>\n> \n\n\n</details>\n\n- Fixes enufacas/Chained#1452\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 We'd love your input!
