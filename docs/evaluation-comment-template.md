1. **Performance Gap**: 46+ percentage point gap between Hall of Fame and active agents
   - Hall of Fame: 76.43% average
   - Active agents: 30.77% average

**Short-term (1 week)**:
- Create mentorship pairings (HoF agents mentor active agents)
- Review evaluation criteria balance
- Analyze the 37 eliminations to learn patterns

**Long-term**:
