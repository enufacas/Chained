# 🎯 AI Goals of the Day

This page tracks the daily goals set by the AI system and progress towards achieving them.

## About AI Goals

The Chained autonomous system sets a new goal every day at 6 AM UTC. These goals are designed to:

- 🎯 **Focus AI effort** on specific improvements
- 📊 **Track progress** with 3-hour check-ins
- 🚀 **Drive continuous improvement** across all areas
- 📈 **Measure autonomous productivity**

### How It Works

1. **Daily at 6 AM UTC**: AI generates a new goal based on:
   - Recent learnings from tech news and trends
   - Current repository state and needs
   - Random selection from improvement categories
   - Previous goal outcomes

2. **Every 3 hours**: Progress checker evaluates:
   - Commits, PRs, and issues since goal was set
   - Activity related to the goal category
   - Overall progress percentage
   - Next recommended actions

3. **Daily completion**: Goals are archived and new ones are generated

### Goal Categories

- **Code Quality**: Refactoring, documentation, best practices
- **Performance**: Optimization, caching, efficiency
- **Documentation**: Guides, examples, architecture docs
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
- **Learning**: New sources, algorithms, analysis
- **Automation**: New workflows, improvements
- **Micro Projects**: New tools and utilities
- **Security**: Scanning, vulnerability fixes
- **Monitoring**: Dashboards, alerts, metrics
- **User Experience**: UI improvements, navigation

## Current Goal
