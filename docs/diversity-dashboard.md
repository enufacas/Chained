## 📚 Pattern Library

Successful diverse approaches and patterns to avoid:

### ✅ Successful Diverse Approaches

#### GitHub Actions workflows for automated processes
**Success Rate:** 85%

Examples:
- Event-driven workflow triggers
- Scheduled automation with cron expressions
- Multi-job orchestration with dependencies

#### Component-based code organization
**Success Rate:** 90%

Examples:
- Separate concerns into focused modules
- Reusable utility functions
- Clear separation of business logic and presentation

#### Configuration and data-driven solutions
**Success Rate:** 80%

Examples:
- JSON/YAML-based configuration
- Template-based generation
- Rule engines for decision logic

#### Test-first development methodology
**Success Rate:** 88%

Examples:
- Unit tests with comprehensive coverage
- Integration tests for system behavior
- Test fixtures and mocking strategies

#### Functional programming paradigms
**Success Rate:** 82%

Examples:
- Pure functions without side effects
- Higher-order functions and composition
- Immutable data structures

### ⚠️  Patterns to Avoid

**Minimal implementation without error handling or documentation**
- ⚠️  Leads to maintenance issues and unclear code

**Duplicating code blocks instead of abstracting**
- ⚠️  Creates maintenance burden and inconsistency

**Large functions doing too many things**
- ⚠️  Reduces readability and testability
