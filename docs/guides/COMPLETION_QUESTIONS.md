# ✅ 8 Mandatory Completion Questions

> **The audit framework that ensures autonomous loop completeness**

Every workflow in the Chained autonomous system MUST be able to answer these 8 questions. Work is incomplete if any answer is missing.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The 8 Mandatory Completion Questions serve as:

1. **Quality Gate**: Ensures workflows actually complete their stage
2. **Audit Trail**: Provides transparency and accountability
3. **Debug Aid**: Makes troubleshooting easier
4. **Documentation**: Self-documents workflow outcomes
5. **Loop Integrity**: Validates the autonomous loop is closed
