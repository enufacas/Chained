### Label System

| Label | Added When | Effect | Removed When |
|-------|------------|--------|--------------|
| `needs-tech-lead-review` | Tech Lead review required | Blocks auto-merge | Tech Lead approval given |
| `tech-lead:workflows-tech-lead` | Workflow changes detected | Identifies reviewer | PR merged/closed |
| `tech-lead:agents-tech-lead` | Agent system changes | Identifies reviewer | PR merged/closed |
| `tech-lead-approved` | Tech Lead approves | Enables auto-merge | Never (approval final) |
| `tech-lead-changes-requested` | Tech Lead requests changes | Blocks auto-merge | Changes addressed |

### Complexity Determination

```python
def is_tech_lead_required(pr_data):
    """Determine if Tech Lead review is mandatory."""
    
    # Protected paths always require review
    if any_file_in_protected_paths(pr_data['files']):
        return True, "Protected path modified"
    
    # Large PRs require review
    if pr_data['files_changed'] > 5 or pr_data['lines_changed'] > 100:
        return True, "Large PR size"
    
    # Security keywords require review
    if any_security_keyword_in_pr(pr_data):
        return True, "Security-related changes"
    
    # Multiple subsystems require coordination
    if multiple_tech_leads_needed(pr_data):
        return True, "Cross-subsystem changes"
    
    # Otherwise optional
    return False, "Simple change, optional review"
```

## 🔑 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Label-Based Control Flow
**Decision:** Use GitHub labels to control review state
**Rationale:** 
- Transparent to all stakeholders
- Easy to inspect and debug
- Integrates with existing GitHub features
- Visible in PR UI

### 2. Path-Based Tech Lead Assignment
**Decision:** Tech Leads own specific directory paths
**Rationale:**
- Clear responsibility boundaries
- Easy to determine which Tech Lead needed
- Scalable to many Tech Leads
- Mirrors CODEOWNERS pattern

### 3. Complexity Thresholds
**Decision:** Multiple factors determine required vs. optional review
**Rationale:**
- Balance thoroughness with velocity
- Focus Tech Lead time on high-risk changes
- Prevent bottlenecks on simple changes
- Configurable for different needs

### 4. Proof-of-Concept Workflow
**Decision:** Separate tech-lead-review-poc.yml workflow
**Rationale:**
- Non-intrusive to existing system
- Easy to test and iterate
- Can be disabled without affecting production
- Clear separation of concerns

### 5. Future GraphQL Assignment
**Decision:** Plan for Tech Lead assignment via GraphQL API
**Rationale:**
- Mirrors existing agent assignment pattern
- Enables Tech Lead to execute review as Copilot
- Access to enhanced MCP server tools
- Consistent with agent system design

## 💡 Key Insights from Brainstorming

### What Works Well

1. **Gradual Adoption**: Start with critical paths (workflows, agents) and expand
2. **Clear Ownership**: Path-based responsibility is intuitive
3. **Label-Based Control**: Transparent and debuggable
4. **Multiple Fix Strategies**: Comment, direct fix, or separate PR
5. **Configurable Thresholds**: Adapt to project needs

### Potential Challenges

1. **Velocity Impact**: Additional review step adds time
2. **Bottleneck Risk**: Tech Lead availability gates merges
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Need clear escalation path
4. **Tool Complexity**: MCP server integration adds moving parts
5. **Maintenance**: Tech Lead agents require ongoing attention

### Solutions Identified

1. **Velocity**: Use complexity thresholds to minimize blocking
2. **Bottleneck**: Multiple Tech Leads per area, clear SLAs
3. **Conflicts**: Repository owner as final arbiter
4. **Tools**: Phased rollout, start without MCP servers
5. **Maintenance**: Protected status for critical Tech Leads

## 🔧 Configuration Examples

### Adding a New Tech Lead

```yaml
# 1. Create .github/agents/security-tech-lead.md
---
name: security-tech-lead
description: Tech Lead for security-critical components
specialization: security
tech_lead_for_paths:
  - src/auth/**
  - src/crypto/**
  - SECURITY.md
---
```

```python
# 2. Add to tools/match-issue-to-agent.py
'security-tech-lead': {
    'keywords': [
        'security', 'auth', 'crypto', 'vulnerability',
        'authentication', 'authorization', 'encryption'
    ],
    'patterns': [
        r'\bsecurity\b', r'\bauth', r'\bcrypto',
        r'\bvulnerabilit', r'\bencrypt'
    ]
}
```

```python
# 3. Configure in tools/match-pr-to-tech-lead.py
TECH_LEAD_PATHS = {
    'security-tech-lead': {
        'patterns': [
            'src/auth/**',
            'src/crypto/**',
            'SECURITY.md'
        ],
        'priority': 'critical'
    }
}
```

### Adjusting Thresholds

```python
# In tools/match-pr-to-tech-lead.py
TECH_LEAD_THRESHOLDS = {
    # Always require review for these paths
    "protected_paths": [
        ".github/workflows/**",
        ".github/agents/**",
        "SECURITY.md",
        "src/auth/**",  # Add critical paths
    ],
    
    # Size thresholds
    "max_files_for_optional": 3,  # Stricter (was 5)
    "max_lines_for_optional": 50,  # Stricter (was 100)
    
    # Keywords requiring review
    "always_require_for_patterns": [
        r"secret", r"password", r"auth",
        r"crypto", r"security", r"token"
    ]
}
```
