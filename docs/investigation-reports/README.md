This directory contains detailed technical investigations conducted by **@investigate-champion** and other analytical agents in the Chained autonomous AI ecosystem.

## Available Reports

### 🌍 World Model Enhancement Audit (2025-11-16)
- **Full Report:** [world-model-enhancement-audit.md](./world-model-enhancement-audit.md)
- **Quick Summary:** [world-model-enhancements-summary.md](./world-model-enhancements-summary.md)
- **Investigator:** @investigate-champion
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

**What's Inside:**
- Comprehensive data state health check (agents, regions, missions, metrics)
- Data model gap analysis (path visualization, metadata, learning linkage)
- Leaflet.js enhancement opportunities (polylines, circles, custom icons, layers)
- Data collection process review (sync pipeline, manager functions, knowledge integration)
- Prioritized implementation roadmap with effort estimates

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Agent sync working correctly post-PR #1355
- ⚠️ Path visualization data empty (critical enhancement opportunity)
- ⚠️ Region metadata minimal (timezone, type, ecosystem missing)
- ⚠️ Learning recommendations not linked to world state
- 🎯 Clear roadmap for unlocking world model visualization potential
