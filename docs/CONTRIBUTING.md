# 🤝 Contributing

While Chained is designed to be autonomous, **external contributions are welcome and require manual review** for security!

## How External Contributions Work

- **Submit PRs**: External contributors can submit pull requests
- **Manual Review**: All external PRs require repository owner review (via CODEOWNERS)
- **Security**: Auto-merge only works for owner and trusted bot PRs with `copilot` label
- **Transparency**: PRs that don't meet auto-merge criteria receive clear feedback

See [SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md](SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for details on how the security model works.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Suggest new ideas**: Add to the ideas array in `idea-generator.yml`
- **Improve workflows**: Enhance the automation logic
- **Enhance the timeline**: Improve the GitHub Pages site
- **Fix issues**: Help resolve issues that AI might struggle with
- **Document learnings**: Create issues tagged with `learning`
