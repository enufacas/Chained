# Architecture Evolution Data

This directory contains automated architecture tracking data for the Chained ecosystem.

## Files

- **latest.json** - Current architecture snapshot
- **evolution.json** - Historical timeline of all snapshots
- **architecture.mmd** - Mermaid diagram of current architecture
- **snapshot_*.json** - Individual timestamped snapshots

## Data Structure

Each snapshot contains:
- Timestamp and git commit information
- Directory structure analysis
- Dependency graph
- Architecture metrics (coupling, complexity)
- Component identification

## Usage

This data is automatically generated by `tools/architecture-tracker.py` and is used by the GitHub Pages visualization at `docs/architecture-evolution.html`.

## Viewing

- **GitHub Pages**: https://enufacas.github.io/Chained/architecture-evolution.html
- **Local**: Run `python3 tools/architecture-tracker.py --help`

## Automation

The architecture tracker runs automatically via `.github/workflows/architecture-evolution.yml` on every PR merge to main.
