We know that security works best when it accounts for the diverse ways people use our tools. This is why we announced this change early: to gather input and ensure our solutions are balanced. We appreciate the community's engagement and have heard the early feedback \u2013 specifically from students and hobbyists who need an accessible path to learn, and from power users who are more comfortable with security risks. We are making changes to address the needs of both groups. To understand how these updates fit into our broader mission, it is important to first look at the specific threats we are tackling. Why verification is important Keeping users safe on Android is our top priority. Combating scams and digital fraud is not new for us \u2014 it has been a central focus of our work for years. From Scam Detection in Google Messages to Google Play Protect and real-time alerts for scam calls, we have consistently acted to keep our ecosystem safe . However, online scams and malware campaigns are becoming more aggressive. At the global scale of Android, this translates to real harm for people around the world \u2013 especially in rapidly digitizing regions where many are coming online for the first time.

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems. The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context. Who are the problems aimed at? The intended audience include students for whom the basic curriculum is not feeding their hunger to learn, adults whose background was not primarily mathematics but had an interest in things mathematical, and professionals who want to keep their problem solving and mathematics on the cutting edge. Currently we have 1365127 registered members who have solved at least one problem, representing 220 locations throughout the world, and collectively using 113 different programming languages to solve the problems. Can anyone solve the problems? The problems range in difficulty and for many the experience is inductive chain learning. That is, by solving one problem it will expose you to a new concept that may allow you to undertake a previously inaccessible problem. So determined participants will be able to slowly but surely work their way through the problems. What next?

World models should reconstruct, generate, and simulate 3D worlds; and allow both humans and agents to interact with them. Spatially intelligent world models will transform a wide variety of industries over the coming years. Two months ago we shared a preview of Marble , our World Model that creates 3D worlds from image or text prompts. Since then, Marble has been available to an early set of beta users to create 3D worlds for themselves. Today we are making Marble, a first-in-class generative multimodal world model, generally available for anyone to use. We have also drastically expanded Marble's capabilities, and are excited to highlight them here: Multimodal Marble : Marble is now massively multimodal. Marble can create 3D worlds from text, images, video, or coarse 3D layouts; Marble also lets you interactively edit, expand, and combine worlds. Once generated, 3D worlds can be exported as Gaussian splats, meshes, or videos. These new capabilities let users create and edit worlds with fine-grained control; and makes those worlds more useful than ever before. Marble Labs : We are launching Marble Labs , a creative hub where imagination meets experimentation. It is where artists, engineers, and designers push the boundaries of world models, showcasing bold ideas, real-world workflows, and new possibilities across gaming, VFX, design, robotics, and beyond. Marble Labs is also home to in-depth case studies, tutorials, and documentation that give anyone the tools to learn, build, and share their own 3D worlds.

This means WhatsApp on Windows 11 is cooked, and it\u2019s back to being absolute garbage in terms of performance. WhatsApp is one of those Windows apps that went from being a web wrapper to a native app and then back to the web again after all these years of investment. WhatsApp for Windows was originally an Electron app, and it was eventually replaced with UWP after years of investment. Four years later, WhatsApp is going back to WebView2, abandoning the original WinUI/UWP native idea. I blame the layoffs My understanding is that the recent layoffs at Mark Zuckerberg-headed Meta likely disbanded the entire team behind the native WhatsApp. I don\u2019t see any other reason why Meta would abandon its native app for Windows. Meta will save costs by maintaining the web app codebase on Windows, but you\u2019re going to hate the experience. How bad is the new WhatsApp for Windows 11? Our tests showed that new Chromium/WebView2-based WhatsApp for Windows 11 uses up to 300MB of RAM when you are on the login screen and doing nothing. On the other hand, the old/native WhatsApp uses just 18MB of RAM and even slips to less than 10MB when left idle on the login screen. After logging in, WhatsApp (new) memory usage increased to 2GB while trying to load all my chats. On average, it used 1.2GB when left idle in the background . You\u2019d realise how bad this is when I tell you the benchmarks for the native WhatsApp for comparison. I tested the old/native WhatsApp, and it uses just 190MB most of the time, dropping to less than 100MB when it\u2019s completely idle. At worst, it would reach 300MB, which can happen only when the chat is really active. \u201cWhatsApp\u201d is new version and \u201cWhatsApp Be\n\n[Content truncated...]",

The online version has been available since 2001, and now there is also a throughly revised version available in book form . We wanted to do two things with this course. First, we wanted to provide a text that was relatively self contained, a text that would permit someone with little or no knowledge of computing to pick up the basics of Prolog with the minimum of fuss. We also wanted the text to be clear enough to make it useful for self study. We believe that if you read the text, and do the associated exercises, you will gain a useful partial entry to the world of Prolog. But only a partial entry, and this brings us to our second point. We want to emphasize the practical aspects of Prolog. Prolog is something you do. You can't learn a programming language simply by reading about it, and if you really want to get the most out of this course, we strongly advise you to get hold of a Prolog interpreter (you'll find pointers to some nice ones on this website) and work through all the Practical Sessions that we provide. And of course, don't stop with what we provide. The more you program, the better you'll get.... We hope you enjoy the course.

In an analysis of more than 6,800 colon cancer patients across all University of California Health sites, researchers found that those taking glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) medications were less than half as likely to die within five years compared to those who weren\u2019t on the drugs (15.5% vs. 37.1%). The study, led by Raphael Cuomo , Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and member of UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, used real-world clinical data from the University of California Health Data Warehouse to assess outcomes across the state\u2019s academic medical centers. After adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), disease severity and other health factors, GLP-1 users still showed significantly lower odds of death, suggesting a strong and independent protective effect. The survival benefit appeared most pronounced in patients with very high BMI (over 35), hinting that GLP-1 drugs may help counteract the inflammatory and metabolic conditions that worsen colon cancer prognosis. Researchers believe several biological mechanisms could explain the link. Beyond regulating blood sugar, GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce systemic inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss \u2014 all factors that can dampen tumor-promot\n\n[Content truncated...]",

Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature --no-quarantine is used to forcibly bypass Gatekeeper, which is a built-in macOS security mechanism. This is used to run unsigned/unnotarized applications. macOS Tahoe is the final release to support Intel systems, and last year Apple updated macOS runtime protection to make it harder to override Gatekeeper. Macs with Apple silicon also don't \" permit native arm64 code to execute unless a valid signature is attached \". Finally, we are ending support for all casks that fail Gatekeeper checks on September 1st, 2026. With the above in mind, it's time to deprecate the --no-quarantine flag from brew . It intentionally bypasses macOS security mechanisms, which we already actively discourage. Deprecating now will give a decent lead time for users using it to come up with another solution or adjust their workflows. What is the motivation for the feature? Intel support is coming to an end from both Apple and Homebrew. This flag is primarily used to override a macOS security mechanism, which we do not want to encourage. Since we are requiring casks fulfill Gatekeeper checks next year, there is no reason to keep this flag. How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?

Please sign in or subscribe to access the full content. Space, as they say, is pretty big, and human-made objects are slow. The record speed any human has ever traveled was set by Apollo 10 back in 1969, and has not been broken since. The fastest human spaceflight remains 39,937.7 kilometers per hour (24,816.1 miles per hour), and at those speeds, it would take 3,730 hours to travel just 1 astronomical unit (AU), the distance between the Earth and the Sun. At around 155 days, that's an unacceptable travel time to (for example) slam into the Sun. And while it takes you 155 days to get wherever it is you went, light and communications from Earth would reach you in about 8 minutes and 20 seconds, really rubbing it in how great it is to be massless. But we will get a real reminder of the vast distance and incredible speed of light in late 2026, when Voyager 1 becomes the first human-made object to reach one light-day away from Earth. This spacecraft was launched in 1977 and has been traveling ever since. At the time of writing, it is around 169.5 AU from the Earth, having become the first spacecraft to go beyond the heliosphere, cross the heliopause , and enter interstellar space. At its current position, it takes 23 hours, 29 minutes, and 27 seconds for signals from Earth to reach the spacecraft. At its current speed of about 61,198 kilometers per hour (38,027 miles per hour), it will still take over a year to widen that light-distance to a full 24 hours. When it does reach 25.9 billion kilometers ( 16 billion miles ) from Earth, a journey that took nearly 50 years, it will finally be the distance that light can travel in a day. According to calculations from IFLScience's resident astronomer, Dr Alfredo Carpineti , using data from NASA's Eyes on the Solar System , this will occur on November 13, 2026. \n\n[Content truncated...]",
