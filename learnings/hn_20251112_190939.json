The online version has been available since 2001, and now there is also a throughly revised version available in book form . We wanted to do two things with this course. First, we wanted to provide a text that was relatively self contained, a text that would permit someone with little or no knowledge of computing to pick up the basics of Prolog with the minimum of fuss. We also wanted the text to be clear enough to make it useful for self study. We believe that if you read the text, and do the associated exercises, you will gain a useful partial entry to the world of Prolog. But only a partial entry, and this brings us to our second point. We want to emphasize the practical aspects of Prolog. Prolog is something you do. You can't learn a programming language simply by reading about it, and if you really want to get the most out of this course, we strongly advise you to get hold of a Prolog interpreter (you'll find pointers to some nice ones on this website) and work through all the Practical Sessions that we provide. And of course, don't stop with what we provide. The more you program, the better you'll get.... We hope you enjoy the course.

The company would eventually become Waymo, autonomous vehicle testing would expand \u2014 fanning out to other cities. Eventually, the company launched commercial robotaxi services in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Other cities soon followed. But freeways, despite some of that early testing, would remain out of reach. Until today. Waymo said Wednesday it will begin offering robotaxi rides that use freeways across San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, a critical expansion for the company that it says will reduce ride times by up to 50%. That stat could help attract a whole new group of users who need to travel between the many towns and suburbs within the greater San Francisco Bay Area or quicken commutes across the sprawling Los Angeles and Phoenix metro areas. Using freeways is also essential for Waymo to offer rides to and from the San Francisco Airport, a location the company is currently testing in. The service won\u2019t be offered to all Waymo riders at first, the company said. Waymo riders who want to experience freeway rides can note their preference in the Waymo app. Once the rider hails a ride, they may be matched with a freeway trip, according to the company. The company\u2019s robotaxi routes will now stretch to San Jose, an expansion that will create a unified 260-mile service area across the Peninsula, according to Waymo.

      "content": "What happened to Transmeta, the last big dotcom IPO Dave Farquhar Retro Computing November 7, 2025 November 7, 2025 2 Comments Transmeta was the last big IPO of the dotcom era , launching Nov 7, 2000. Some analysts call its $273 million IPO the last successful tech IPO until the Google IPO in 2004 . Transmeta didn\u2019t completely fit in to the dotcom era, because they were a hardware company. But they were still a technology company, and if their plans had gone well, they would have sold their product to dotcoms, but it didn\u2019t work out that way for them. In this blog post we explore what happened to Transmeta. Was Transmeta truly the last of the dotcoms? Transmeta was a CPU company, a pure technology play as investors cooled on Internet companies. Its IPO feels like the end of the dotcom era, even though the line feels a bit fuzzy.. I\u2019ve heard Transmeta called the last successful IPO of the dotcom era, or the last of the big dotcom IPOs. But it\u2019s an oversimplification to say there weren\u2019t any successful technology IPOs between Transmeta and Google. One very notable exception is Paypal, who ran an IPO in February 2002 that raised $70.2 million. The Register even hailed Paypal as the return of the Internet IPO. And it wasn\u2019t just that dotcom IPOs grew scarce after November 2000. On February 7, 2002, Forbes stated that only 34 IPOs in total launched between September 11, 2001 and February 6, 2002, compared to 87 in the same-year-earlier period, and 240 between September 11, 1999 and February 6, 2000. That date is significant. Any bad news can spook investors, and the 9/11 attack did, in fact, spook investors. So where the dotcom-era ended is a fuzzy line, but it makes sense to draw the line at Transmeta. Technology IPOs and particularly Internet IPOs became much more scarce after Transmeta, and the size of the IPOs shrunk too. The distinction of Transmeta being a technology stock, rather than an Internet stock, also suggests investors were already cooling on Internet stoc\n\n[Content truncated...]"

LeCun, a Turing Award-winning pioneer of modern AI, has begun early fundraising discussions for his new venture, which will focus on developing \"world models,\" next-generation systems designed to learn from visual and spatial data rather than text. These models aim to replicate human reasoning and understanding of the physical world, a project LeCun has said could take a decade to mature. LeCun's exit comes amid an internal overhaul of Meta's AI strategy. Zuckerberg has shifted Meta's Fundamental AI Research Lab - FAIR, which LeCun founded in 2013, away from long-term research toward commercial AI products and large language models - LLMs. The move follows the underwhelming release of Meta's Llama 4 model, which lagged behind rival offerings from Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI. To accelerate progress, Zuckerberg recently hired Alexandr Wang, founder of Scale AI, paying $14.3 billion for a 49 percent stake in his company and appointing him to lead Meta's new Superintelligence division, to which LeCun now reports. The CEO also formed an elite team called TBD Lab, offering $100 million pay packages to lure top AI talent from competitors.

The new Bluetooth Core 6.2 specification also introduces various BLE Test Mode enhancements. If you feel like Bluetooth specifications are released more often than in the past, that\u2019s normal because the Bluetooth SIG switched to a bi-annual release schedule. For instance, the Bluetooth 6.1 specification was just published last May, or about 6 months ago\u2026 Bluetooth 6.2 highlights: Bluetooth Shorter Connection Intervals (SCI) reduce the minimum Bluetooth LE connection interval from 7.5 ms to just 375 \u00b5s for faster responsiveness. The change will especially impact high-performance HID devices, real-time human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and latency-sensitive sensors. AR/VR and gaming applications will particularly benefit from the lower latency. Bluetooth Channel Sounding Amplitude-based Attack Resilience adds protections against sophisticated amplitude-based RF attacks. Devices for the automotive, smart home, and industrial markets will become less prone to relay and spoofing threats with the changes. Bluetooth HCI USB LE Isochronous Support gets Bulk Serialization Mode , a new mechanism for standardizing isochronous data transmission over USB. With this update, host-controller interface (HCI) packet handling will be simplified, and it also streamlines LE Audio integration in Bluetooth USB devices.

Sunspot region 4274 produced its strongest solar flare thus far since it appeared on the east limb and the sixth strongest solar flare of the current solar cycle. An impressive long duration and highly eruptive X5.1 (R3-strong) solar flare peaked this morning at 10:04 UTC. It became quickly clear that the eruption would be followed by an impressive coronal mass ejection (CME). The resulting coronal wave following the solar explosion as well as the coronal dimming observed as the CME was propelled into space were of a spectacular magnitude as can be seen in the animation below provided by halocme . Another eruption from AR12474, associated with an X5.1 flare. It has become a full halo CME. I am truly impressed by how fast and global this coronal wave is. The CME will arrive on November 13, but because of earlier CMEs it will be challenging to isolate the ICME from this. pic.twitter.com/H6eNjzQUGz \u2014 Halo CME (@halocme) November 11, 2025 Taking a look at coronagraph imagery provided by GOES-19 CCOR-1 we see the gorgeous fast halo coronal mass ejection as it propagates away from the Sun. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that this plasma cloud of course has an earth-directed component and it is pretty clear that this will be a strong impact when it arrives at our planet. This rightfully so prompted the NOAA SWPC to issue a G4 or greater geomagnetic storm watch for tomorrow as the cloud could impact our planet as early as 16 UTC on 12 November. Not only is the CME fast but it will also travel trough an area with high ambient solar wind speed and low density thanks to two other CMEs released earlier by this region. More about that below.
