## What is Requestly?

Requestly is a free, open-source API client and HTTP interceptor that serves as an alternative to Postman, Charles Proxy, Fiddler, and Insomnia. It combines API testing capabilities with powerful request interception features.

## Core Capabilities

### 🔄 HTTP Interception
- Intercept and modify HTTP/HTTPS requests in real-time
- Change headers, query parameters, request/response bodies
- Delay or block requests for testing
- Redirect requests dynamically
- Works without VPN or complex proxy setup

### 🚀 API Client
- Send and manage API requests
- Organize requests in collections
- Manage multiple environments
- JavaScript scripting for pre/post-request logic
- Support for all major auth methods (OAuth, Bearer, API Keys, Basic Auth)

### 🎭 API Mocking
- Create mock responses without changing backend code
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Simulate various API scenarios
- GraphQL endpoint mocking

### 🤝 Collaboration
- Team workspaces
- One-click sharing
- Git sync for version control
- Local-first, privacy-focused approach

### 🔒 Security & Privacy
- Direct API communication (no intermediary servers)
- SOC-II compliant
- SSO integration
- Role-based access control

## Platform Support
