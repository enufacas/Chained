## 4. Content Quality Deep Dive

### Rejected Stories Analysis

**@investigate-champion** examined why two stories were rejected:

1. **"Our investigation into the suspicious pressure on Archive.today"**
   - **Likely Reason**: Sensational or conspiratorial title pattern
   - **Quality Filter**: Title suggests investigation content which may be speculative
   - **Pattern**: System correctly filtering potentially low-quality or inflammatory content

2. **"AMD GPUs Go Brrr"**
   - **Likely Reason**: Meme-style title lacking professional context
   - **Quality Filter**: "Go Brrr" is internet slang, may indicate low substance
   - **Pattern**: Despite HipKittens AMD story being included, this title format triggered quality filters
   - **Observation**: Content might have been valuable (AMD GPU optimization) but title quality failed threshold

**Learning**: Quality filters are working well - 86.7% acceptance means we're capturing substantial content while filtering noise.

### Content Depth Analysis

**Stories with Full Article Content**: 13/13 (100%)

**Content Length Distribution**:
- Detailed (2000+ chars): 7 stories (54%)
- Moderate (1000-2000 chars): 4 stories (31%)
- Brief (500-1000 chars): 2 stories (15%)

**@investigate-champion Assessment**: Excellent content depth. Most stories include substantial article excerpts, providing context beyond headlines. The intelligent parser is successfully extracting meaningful content from diverse sources.
