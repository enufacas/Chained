## 📰 From Agent Evolution System Implementation


### Genetic Algorithm Evolution for AI Agents


**Content Summary:**

The Agent Evolution System introduces Darwinian evolution to the Chained ecosystem. High-performing agents (fitness >= 0.5) can breed to create offspring with mixed traits from both parents. The system implements: (1) Fitness-based selection using overall_score + longevity_bonus, (2) Uniform crossover where each gene is randomly inherited from either parent, (3) Random mutations at 15% rate with ±20 point variations bounded [0,100], (4) Complete lineage tracking with parent-offspring relationshi...

---


### Integration Patterns for Autonomous Systems


**Content Summary:**

The evolution system integrates with existing infrastructure through: (1) Weekly cron job (Sundays at midnight) after agent evaluation, (2) Automatic issue creation documenting each generation, (3) Git commits for evolution data persistence, (4) Compatibility with existing agent registry format, (5) Manual integration point for adding offspring to active population. Key design decision: Keep evolution separate from spawning to maintain modularity. The system generates evolution data that can be ...

### Genetic Diversity Through Specialization Mutations


**Content Summary:**

Specialization mutation occurs at 3% rate (15% base * 0.2) and only shifts to related types. Families defined: organize-* (refactoring agents), secure-* (security agents), engineer-* (builders), assert-* (testers), etc. This prevents random specialization chaos while enabling evolutionary adaptation. For example: organize-guru can mutate to organize-specialist or refactor-champion, but not to secure-ninja. This maintains coherent agent identities while allowing gradual specialization evolution. ...

**Link:** https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider/issues/2227


**Content Summary:**

### Issue

Hello!

Please add GitHub Copilot as model provider.

Should be possible like this: https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/blob/5c5a5c759b8c925e81f8584a0279eefc8a6c6643/lua/codecompanion/adapters/copilot.lua

### GitHub Discussion: Ability to import docker-compose defintion and convert them as Copilot app and services

**Link:** https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli/issues/1612


**Content Summary:**

Docker compose is commonly used for local development and testing. We need an ability for Copilot to import Docker Compose files and convert them as Copilot native app and svc objects, in a guide way. This will be a big boost for developers.

### GitHub Discussion: Ability to use Free Models (0x credits) in Copilot CLI

**Link:** https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/32


**Content Summary:**

### Describe the feature or problem you'd like to solve

The Copilot CLI uses Sonnet 4 by default which incurs 1x cost / message.

### Proposed solution

In the Copilot CLI, I wish we could select from a list of free models provided by GitHub Copilot eg. GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, GPT-5 mini, Grok Code Fast 1 etc. This would let us optimize our monthly quota. Thank you for considering.

### GitHub Discussion: sync github copilot chat history across devices

**Link:** https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release/issues/991


**Content Summary:**

I really wish it were possible to sync copilot chat histories across devices, ex: I use a laptop on the go and a desktop at home. I usually keep both devices lock-step via GitHub but it sucks that the chat history is different on both devices. I can usually enter in the same prompt to get a similar answer but it just seems counter intuitive that the chats do not sync by default, or there is not at least an option to sync the chats. Thanks

### Launch HN: Tweeks (YC W25) – Browser extension to deshittify the web

**Link:** https://www.tweeks.io/onboarding


Hey HN! We’re Jason &amp; Matt and we’re building Tweeks (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tweeks.io">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tweeks.io</a>), a browser extension that lets you modify any website in your browser to add functionality, filter&#x2F;highlight, re-theme, reorganize, de-clutter, etc. If you’ve used Violentmonkey&#x2F;Tampermonkey, Tweeks is like a next‑generation userscript manager. Instead of digging through selectors and hand‑writing custom JS&#x2F;CSS, describe what you want in natural language and Tweeks plans + generates your edits and applies them.<p>The modern web is so full of clutter and junk (banners, modals, feeds, and recommendations you didn’t ask for). Even a simple google search is guarded by multiple ads, an AI overview, a trending searches module, etc. before you even see the first real blue link.<p>Every day there&#x27;s a new Lovable-like product (make it simple to build your own website&#x2F;app) or a new agentic browser (AI agents click around and browse the web for you), but we built Tweeks to serve the middle ground: most of our time spent on the web is on someone else&#x27;s site (not our own), and we don&#x27;t want to offload everything to an agentic browser. We want to be able to shape the entire web to our own preferences as we browse.<p>I spent years working on recommendation systems and relevance at Pinterest, and understand how well-meaning recommendations and A&#x2F;B tests can lead to website enshittification. No one sets out to make UX worse, but optimizing for an “average” user is not the same as optimizing for each individual user.<p>I’ve also been hacking “page fixers” as long as I can remember: remove a login wall here, collapse cookie banners there, add missing filters&#x2F;highlights (first with F12&#x2F;inspect element and eventually graduated to advanced GreaseMonkey userscripts). Tweeks started as a weekend prototype that turned simple requests into page edits but unexpectedly grew into something people kept asking to share. We hope you’ll like it too!<p>How it works: Open the Tweeks extension, type your request (e.g. “hide cookie banners and add a price&#x2F;quality score”), and submit. Upon submission, the page structure is captured, an AI agent reviews the structure, plans changes, and returns deterministic transformations (selectors, layout tweaks, styles, and small scripts) that run locally. Your modifications persist across page loads and can be enabled&#x2F;disabled, modified, and shared.<p>Here are a bunch of one‑shot examples from early users:<p><i>Youtube</i>: Remove Youtube Shorts.

### Ask HN: Is building for the web even worth it now?

**Link:** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45924891


Of late, I’ve found my relationship with internet changing. I was here back in the early 2000s and it has always been the first place I go to for entertainment, advice, and work<p>But increasingly, I find myself completely disengaged with the internet. Every time I see a text post, I start asking myself: is this even a real person? Am I just talking to a bot?<p>Every time I see a yellow-tinged image on any of my social media feeds, I mentally switch off. I know it was made by AI and I just find it hard to engage with anything AI-made, no matter how good<p>Same for any AI video that pops up on my feed. It just doesn’t make me scroll past it, it makes me question why am I even here and I end up leaving<p>I know I can’t be the only one. I used to love the internet because it was one place where I could engage with people from all over the world. But now, it feels like I just spend half my energy on figuring out which one is real, which one is AI<p>The line will eventually blur and as a late 30s guy, I really don’t want to spend any more of my time on earth talking to a bot<p>As someone who used to create and build for the web, I find myself increasingly disengaged and discouraged. I’m pouring into a rapidly emptying cup<p>Anyone else feel the same way?
