### Show HN: Chirp – Local Windows dictation with ParakeetV3 no executable required

**Link:** https://github.com/Whamp/chirp


I’ve been working in fairly locked‑down Windows environments where I’m allowed to run Python, but not install or launch new `.exe` files. In addition the built-in windows dictations are blocked (the only good one isn&#x27;t local anyway). At the same time, I really wanted accurate, fast dictation without sending audio to a cloud service, and without needing a GPU. Most speech‑to‑text setups I tried either required special launchers, GPU access, or were awkward to run day‑to‑day.<p>To scratch that itch, I built Chirp, a Windows dictation app that runs fully locally, uses NVIDIA’s ParakeetV3 model, and is managed end‑to‑end with `uv`. If you can run Python on your machine, you should be able to run Chirp—no additional executables required.<p>Under the hood, Chirp uses the Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 ONNX bundle. ParakeetV3 has accuracy in the same ballpark as Whisper‑large‑v3 (multilingual WER ~4.9 vs ~5.0 in the open ASR leaderboard), but it’s much faster and happy on CPU.<p>The flow is:
- One‑time setup that downloads and prepares the ONNX model:
  - `uv run python -m chirp.setup`
- A long‑running CLI process:
  - `uv run python -m chirp.main`
- A global hotkey that starts&#x2F;stops recording and injects text into the active window.<p>A few details that might be interesting technically:<p>- <i>Local‑only STT:</i> Everything runs on your machine using ONNX Runtime; by default it uses CPU providers, with optional GPU providers if your environment allows.<p>- <i>Config‑driven behavior:</i> A `config.toml` file controls the global hotkey, model choice, quantization (`int8` option), language, ONNX providers, and threading. There’s also a simple `[word_overrides]` map so you can fix tokens that the model consistently mishears.<p>- <i>Post‑processing pipeline:</i> After recognition, there’s an optional “style guide” step where you can specify prompts like “sentence case” or “prepend: &gt;&gt;” for the final text.<p>- <i>No clipboard gymnastics required on Windows:</i> The app types directly into the focused window; there are options for clipboard‑based pasting and cleanup behavior for platforms where that makes more sense.<p>- <i>Audio feedback:</i> Start&#x2F;stop sounds (configurable) let you know when the mic is actually recording.<p>So far I’ve mainly tested this on my own Windows machines with English dictation and CPU‑only setups. There are probably plenty of rough edges (different keyboard layouts, language settings, corporate IT policies, etc.), and I’d love feedback from people who:<p>- Work in restricted corporate environments and need local dictation.
- Have experience with Parakeet&#x2F;Whisper or ONNX Runtime and see obvious ways to improve performance or robustness.
- Want specific features (e.g., better multi‑language support, more advanced post‑processing, or integrations with their editor&#x2F;IDE).<p>Repo is here:  
`<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Whamp&#x2F;chirp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Whamp&#x2F;chirp</a>`<p>If you try it, I’d be very interested in:<p>- CPU usage and latency on your hardware,
- How well it behaves with your keyboard layout and applications,
- Any weird failure cases or usability annoyances you run into.<p>Happy to answer questions and dig into technical details in the comments.

**Content Summary:**

← 2 Years of ML vs. 1 Month of Prompting November 7, 2025 Recalls at major automakers cost hundreds of millions of dollars a year. It’s a huge issue. To mitigate it, our company created an analytics department solely focused on categorizing warranty claims into actionable problems. For decades, this team has relied on SQL queries to classify warranty data. But vehicles—and the language used to describe them—have evolved. SQL struggles with semantics, negations, and contextual nuance. Here’s a fi...

### Launch HN: Tweeks (YC W25) – Browser extension to deshittify the web

**Link:** https://www.tweeks.io/onboarding


Hey HN! We’re Jason &amp; Matt and we’re building Tweeks (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tweeks.io">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tweeks.io</a>), a browser extension that lets you modify any website in your browser to add functionality, filter&#x2F;highlight, re-theme, reorganize, de-clutter, etc. If you’ve used Violentmonkey&#x2F;Tampermonkey, Tweeks is like a next‑generation userscript manager. Instead of digging through selectors and hand‑writing custom JS&#x2F;CSS, describe what you want in natural language and Tweeks plans + generates your edits and applies them.<p>The modern web is so full of clutter and junk (banners, modals, feeds, and recommendations you didn’t ask for). Even a simple google search is guarded by multiple ads, an AI overview, a trending searches module, etc. before you even see the first real blue link.<p>Every day there&#x27;s a new Lovable-like product (make it simple to build your own website&#x2F;app) or a new agentic browser (AI agents click around and browse the web for you), but we built Tweeks to serve the middle ground: most of our time spent on the web is on someone else&#x27;s site (not our own), and we don&#x27;t want to offload everything to an agentic browser. We want to be able to shape the entire web to our own preferences as we browse.<p>I spent years working on recommendation systems and relevance at Pinterest, and understand how well-meaning recommendations and A&#x2F;B tests can lead to website enshittification. No one sets out to make UX worse, but optimizing for an “average” user is not the same as optimizing for each individual user.<p>I’ve also been hacking “page fixers” as long as I can remember: remove a login wall here, collapse cookie banners there, add missing filters&#x2F;highlights (first with F12&#x2F;inspect element and eventually graduated to advanced GreaseMonkey userscripts). Tweeks started as a weekend prototype that turned simple requests into page edits but unexpectedly grew into something people kept asking to share. We hope you’ll like it too!<p>How it works: Open the Tweeks extension, type your request (e.g. “hide cookie banners and add a price&#x2F;quality score”), and submit. Upon submission, the page structure is captured, an AI agent reviews the structure, plans changes, and returns deterministic transformations (selectors, layout tweaks, styles, and small scripts) that run locally. Your modifications persist across page loads and can be enabled&#x2F;disabled, modified, and shared.<p>Here are a bunch of one‑shot examples from early users:<p><i>Youtube</i>: Remove Youtube Shorts.

### Ask HN: Is building for the web even worth it now?

**Link:** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45924891


Of late, I’ve found my relationship with internet changing. I was here back in the early 2000s and it has always been the first place I go to for entertainment, advice, and work<p>But increasingly, I find myself completely disengaged with the internet. Every time I see a text post, I start asking myself: is this even a real person? Am I just talking to a bot?<p>Every time I see a yellow-tinged image on any of my social media feeds, I mentally switch off. I know it was made by AI and I just find it hard to engage with anything AI-made, no matter how good<p>Same for any AI video that pops up on my feed. It just doesn’t make me scroll past it, it makes me question why am I even here and I end up leaving<p>I know I can’t be the only one. I used to love the internet because it was one place where I could engage with people from all over the world. But now, it feels like I just spend half my energy on figuring out which one is real, which one is AI<p>The line will eventually blur and as a late 30s guy, I really don’t want to spend any more of my time on earth talking to a bot<p>As someone who used to create and build for the web, I find myself increasingly disengaged and discouraged. I’m pouring into a rapidly emptying cup<p>Anyone else feel the same way?

### Show HN: DBOS Java – Postgres-Backed Durable Workflows

**Link:** https://github.com/dbos-inc/dbos-transact-java


Hi HN - I’m Peter, here with Harry (devhawk), and we’re building DBOS Java, an open-source Java library for durable workflows, backed by Postgres.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dbos-inc&#x2F;dbos-transact-java" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dbos-inc&#x2F;dbos-transact-java</a><p>Essentially, DBOS helps you write long-lived, reliable code that can survive failures, restarts, and crashes without losing state or duplicating work. As your workflows run, it checkpoints each step they take in a Postgres database. When a process stops (fails, restarts, or crashes), your program can recover from those checkpoints to restore its exact state and continue from where it left off, as if nothing happened.<p>In practice, this makes it easier to build reliable systems for use cases like AI agents, payments, data synchronization, or anything that takes hours, days, or weeks to complete. Rather than bolting on ad-hoc retry logic and database checkpoints, durable workflows give you one consistent model for ensuring your programs can recover from any failure from exactly where they left off.<p>This library contains all you need to add durable workflows to your program: there&#x27;s no separate service or orchestrator or any external dependencies except Postgres. Because it&#x27;s just a library, you can incrementally add it to your projects, and it works out of the box with frameworks like Spring. And because it&#x27;s built on Postgres, it natively supports all the tooling you&#x27;re familiar with (backups, GUIs, CLI tools) and works with any Postgres provider.<p>If you want to try it out, check out the quickstart:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.dbos.dev&#x2F;quickstart?language=java" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.dbos.dev&#x2F;quickstart?language=java</a><p>We&#x27;d love to hear what you think! We’ll be in the comments for the rest of the day to answer any questions.
