For some volume of sales that comes into the business, it gives an idea of what percentage is left as cash in the end. Barring some accounting shenanigans regarding where the bottom line is. The size of margins is often cited to explain how businesses behave: \"Amazon was incentivized to move to cloud hosting and AWS as a higher-margin business than retail, whereas Google could not have been the first mover in hosting because advertising has higher margins.\" It's a compelling story, though hard to prove definitively as an important part of the company's behavior. Here, let's instead look at some cold hard empirical data about operating margins of real companies. Using everyone's favorite website as the source, we get yearly operating margins of >10,000 public companies alongside business categories and market caps. We look at the last available year, 2025, and cluster by category. To summarize a category, we can straightforwardly take the median margin over all companies in the category. This produces some counterintuitive results, with for example Semiconductors showing a mediocre median margin of 10%. While this is a perfectly meaningful result, it obscures the fact that the category is dominated by a few large outlier companies with very high margins. And of course it's no coincidence that companies with high margins are the largest; those margins are what allowed them to grow in the first place, while their size conversely gives them pricing power and thus higher margins. We therefore also put in an average margin weighted by market cap. Using the weighted average, Semiconductors sits at an exceptional 42%. Here is an interactive plot of median vs weighted average margins for each category, where the size of the dot is the total market cap of companies in the category. The bulk of the companies sit at around a margin of 10%, bu\n\n[Content truncated...]",

This was based on systematic evaluations showing cyber capabilities doubling in six months; we\u2019d also been tracking real-world cyberattacks, observing how malicious actors were using AI capabilities. While we predicted these capabilities would continue to evolve, what has stood out to us is how quickly they have done so at scale.

The attackers used AI\u2019s \u201cagentic\u201d capabilities to an unprecedented degree\u2014using AI not just as an advisor, but to execute the cyberattacks themselves. The threat actor\u2014whom we assess with high confidence was a Chinese state-sponsored group\u2014manipulated our Claude Code tool into attempting infiltration into roughly thirty global targets and succeeded in a small number of cases. The operation targeted large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies. We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention. Upon detecting this activity, we immediately launched an investigation to understand its scope and nature. Over the following ten days, as we mapped the severity and full extent of the operation, we banned accounts as they were identified, notified affected entities as appropriate, and coordinated with authorities as we gathered actionable intelligence.

I already donated Remind me later Introducing an innovation space within the Blender project, where designers and developers can work together on challenging or future-facing projects, to keep Blender relevant in the years to come. Over the years, Blender has grown and matured into a powerful and complex piece of software. With its unstoppable release cycle, a massive, highly demanding, and diverse user community, natural technical debt, and complex technical dependencies, shipping new features and general improvements requires more and more effort and coordination. Software stability and reliability have become critical for individuals and companies. As a consequence, development efforts focus on those aspects, offering progressive improvements of existing functionality only when these are clear enhancements of what is already there. This makes it more challenging to innovate, think outside the box, experiment, and break things. To facilitate this essential aspect of product development, the Blender Foundation is establishing a new project: the Blender Lab. This is the innovation space where designers, developers, and researchers work together on challenging and future-facing projects that will help Blender stay relevant in the years to come.

We not only debate their technical merits and aesthetic qualities, but they become integrated into our personal identities, along with the values and traits that we associate with them. Some even defend a form of Linguistic Determinism that thinking is confined to what the language makes typable. Since we spend so much time writing code, a keen interest in language design is justified. However, the character of these discussions suggests that we think of them as much more, and have perhaps forgotten their primary role. Programming languages are implementation tools for instructing machines, not thinking tools for expressing ideas. They are strict formal systems riddled with design compromises and practical limitations. At the end of the day, we hope they make controlling computers bearable for humans. In contrast, thoughts are best expressed through a medium which is free and flexible. Thinking in Math The natural language which has been effectively used for thinking about computation, for thousands of years, is mathematics. Most people don\u2019t think of math as free or flexible. They think of scary symbols and memorizing steps to regurgitate on tests. Others hear math and think category theory, lambda calculus, or other methods of formalizing computation itself, but these are hardly necessary for programming itself. I hope readers of this article have had a better experience regarding what math is about, such as a graph theory, algorithms, or linear algebra course; the kind that involves logic and theorems, and is written in prose with a mix of symbols (most symbols weren\u2019t even invented until the 16th century ).

Share \u2022 18 days ago \u2022 View on X Before we all mute the word 'dithering' I thought I'd explain a little bit about why we needed to dither digital images in the first place. Although it's an aesthetic now, we used to need dithering to trick our eyes into seeing more colors than were actually there. \ud83d\udc47 So in the early days of computing, memory was scarce and we couldn't store a lot of color detail. To get around this we used limited palettes with lookup tables or really low bit depth colors, to reduce the number of colors in an image, also called quantization. The problem with quantization is it creates hard steps where there should be gradual gradients - we don't have a color in between these. This is where dithering comes in. We can approximate this gradient by adding some noise with the two neighbouring colors. Dithering is effective because of something called spatial averaging - basically your eye takes an average of a small area of color. Dithering tricks our eyes into inferring a smooth step between the two banks of color, like a low pass filter. So how do we dither an image? Well there are quite a few approaches so lets start with the simple one, ordered dithering. For the sake of simplicity lets use a monochrome image. Our goal is to recreate the grey tones in the image using just black and white. To start, we create a 2x2 Bayer matrix, where the values are the order in which we will process the pixels. We then scale those values to the range we need, 0-255, which gives us a threshold map we can use to compare pixels against. Next, we divide the image into 2x2 pixel groups and compare each pixel value to the values in our map, in that weird criss-cross order. If it's higher than the value in our map, we turn it white and if it's lower we turn it black. Because we have a 2x2 matrix, there's actually only 5 possible results for any quadrant, which means there are only 3 shades of grey in between white and bl\n\n[Content truncated...]",
