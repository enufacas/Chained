While it promises structure for AI-driven programming, it risks burying agility under layers of Markdown. This post explores why a more iterative, natural-language approach may better fit modern development. The Rise of Specification Coding assistants are intimidating: instead of an IDE full of familiar menus and buttons, developers are left with a simple chat input. How can we ensure that the code is correct with so little guidance? To help people write good software with coding assistants, the open-source community designed a clever way to guide a coding agent. Based on an initial prompt and a few instructions, an LLM generates product specifications, an implementation plan, and a detailed list of tasks. Each document depends on the previous one, and users can edit the documents to refine the spec. Eventually, these documents are handed over to a coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, you name it). The agent, now properly guided, should write solid code that satisfies the business requirements. This approach is called Spec-Driven Development (SDD), and several toolkits can get you started. To name a few: Spec-Kit by GitHub Kiro by AWS Tessl by Tessl BMad Method (BMM) by BMad Code If you want a comparison of these tools, I recommend the excellent article Understanding Spec-Driven-Development: Kiro, spec-kit, and Tessl by Birgitta B\u00f6ckeler. The Markdown Awakens How does a spec look? It\u2019s essentially a bunch of Markdown files. Here\u2019s an example using GitHub\u2019s spec-kit, where a developer wanted to display the current date on a time-tracking app, resulting in 8 files and 1,300 lines of text : Here\u2019s another example using\n\n[Content truncated...]",

We think that opening up AI\u2019s compute landscape is one of the most important problems to be working on right now. Building towards this goal, we present HipKittens: SoTA AMD kernels and a collection of opinionated programming primitives to make AMD kernel dev easier! Named after AMD's CUDA equivalent, called HIP . Building towards multi-silicon AI systems While AI has largely used a single hardware vendor to get to its current stage, AMD GPU hardware now offers state-of-the-art peak compute and memory bandwidth.

The AMD software ecosystem includes AITER , a high performance AI kernel library; PyTorch and a few compilers ( Triton , Mojo , TileLang ); and Composable Kernel (CK) , AMD's C++ based programming model for writing kernels. However, despite gigawatt-scale AMD deployments , the software remains brittle. The existing software offerings fail to consistently achieve peak performance. CK kernels frequently underperform (see our evaluations below). AITER and PyTorch are volatile; for instance, AITER and PyTorch SDPA Llama GQA backwards kernels achieve just 30% and 24% of SoTA performance respectively on AMD MI355X GPUs.

It's unfortunately no longer enough to force websites to check your government-issued ID before you can access certain content, because politicians have now discovered that people are using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to protect their privacy and bypass these invasive laws. Their solution? Entirely ban the use of VPNs. Yes, really. As of this writing, Wisconsin lawmakers are escalating their war on privacy by targeting VPNs in the name of \u201cprotecting children\u201d in A.B. 105 / S.B. 130 . It\u2019s an age verification bill that requires all websites distributing material that could conceivably be deemed \u201csexual content\u201d to both implement an age verification system and also to block the access of users connected via VPN. The bill seeks to broadly expand the definition of materials that are \u201charmful to minors\u201d beyond the type of speech that states can prohibit minors from accessing\u2014potentially encompassing things like depictions and discussions of human anatomy, sexuality, and reproduction. This follows a notable pattern: As we\u2019ve explained previously , lawmakers, prosecutors, and activists in conservative states have worked for years to aggressively expand the definition of \u201charmful to minors\u201d to censor a broad swath of content: diverse educational materials , sex education resources , art, and even award-winning literature . Wisconsin\u2019s bill has already passed the State Assembly and is now moving through the Senate. If it becomes law, Wisconsin could become the first state where using a VPN to access certain content is banned. Michigan lawmakers have proposed similar legislation that did not move through its legislature, but among other things, would force internet providers to actively monitor and block VPN connections. And in the UK, officials are calling VPNs \"a loophole that needs closing.\" This is actually happenin\n\n[Content truncated...]",

Words by Jennifer Justus | Photos by Houston Cofield Portaits featured in this story were taken at Peabody High School and Trenton Elementary School in Trenton, Tennessee. November 4, 2025 Granny won me over with the government cheese. As a child, maybe 4 or 5 years old, when I\u2019d visit her on occasional Sundays in Blue Ridge, Georgia, she\u2019d slice me off a little treat \u2014 an orange rectangle from a brown cardboard box in the refrigerator. We would sit around her kitchen table, where she held court with my aunts by telling stories and making plans for canning vegetables. Sometimes the aunts smoked cigarettes, which they\u2019d quickly stamp out when my preacher-grandfather came around the corner. Nevermind that my snack was processed and inexpensive, a generic type of Velveeta. In those days at Granny\u2019s, sitting with my cheese and the grown-ups in our rural mountain town, I might as well have been tasting Camembert on the banks of the Seine. Nevermind, too, the Mason jars of homemade soup on her shelves, a kaleidoscope of summer\u2019s bounty \u2014 tomatoes, okra, corn \u2014 put up and waiting to take the chill off colder days. Nevermind the freshly baked pound cakes under Tupperware domes like trophies, which she kept atop the washing machine, also in the kitchen, or the biscuits she could whip up with nary a measuring device or recipe. I would learn to appreciate all those later. As a kid, the cheese wowed me. My mother tried to explain that it was a commodity provided by government funding for the school cafeteria where my grandmother worked. \u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t mention the cheese,\u201d Mom said recently, when I told her about writing this story. She has a good point. Folks don\u2019t like to hear the words processed and school food in the same sentence. And Mom wouldn\u2019t want people to think Granny was somehow taking advantage of the system. But don\u2019t worry, Mom. The cheese is p\n\n[Content truncated...]",

      "content": "Much of the developer world is familiar with the AWS outage in us-east-1 that occurred on October 20th due to a race condition bug inside a DNS management service. The backlog of events we needed to process from that outage on the 20th stretched our system to the limits, and so we decided to increase our headroom for event handling throughput. When we attempted that infrastructure upgrade on October 23rd, we ran into yet another race condition bug in Aurora RDS. This is the story of how we figured out it was an AWS bug (later confirmed by AWS) and what we learned. Background The Hightouch Events product enables organizations to gather and centralize user behavioral data such as page views, clicks, and purchases. Customers can setup syncs to load events into a cloud data warehouse for analytics or stream them directly to marketing, operational, and analytics tools to support real-time personalization use cases. Here is the portion of Hightouch\u2019s architecture dedicated to our events system: Hightouch events system architecture Our system scales on three levers: Kubernetes clusters that contain event collectors and batch workers, Kafka for event processing, and Postgres as our virtual queue metadata store. When our pagers went off during the AWS outage on the 20th, we observed: Services were unable to connect to Kafka brokers managed by AWS MSK. Services struggled to autoscale because we couldn\u2019t provision new EC2 nodes. Customer functions for realtime data transformation were unavailable due to AWS STS errors, which caused our retry queues to balloon in size. Kafka\u2019s durability meant that no events were dropped once they were accepted by the collectors, but there was a massive backlog to process. Syncs with consistently high traffic or with enrichments that needed to call slower 3rd party services took longer to catch up and were testing the limits of our (small) Postgres instance\u2019s ability to act as a queue for the batch metadata.
