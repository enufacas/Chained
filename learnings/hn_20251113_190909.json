Some teammates jot down their schedule deviations, while others detail what they intend to focus on for the week. Nathan just wrapped up top-of-mind announcements and Morgan is sharing trends from our metrics and covering operational updates. Meanwhile I'm preparing user quotes from the last week to share out, and others add topics to the Discussions section. Throughout the meeting, screens are being shared, various voices are popping in and out of the conversation, and our notes are growing rapidly as dozens of cursors are concurrently editing the same file in real-time. This entire meeting is taking place inside Zed. Our weekly \"all hands\" Monday meeting in Zed Our mission from the beginning has been to engineer an editor that will be: Responsive : The latency between keystroke and re-render should be imperceptible. Focused : The interface should offer minimal distractions and stay out of the code's way. Collaborative : Working with teammates should feel no different than sitting next to them in the office. Setting the first two properties aside, let's focus on collaboration. Collaboration Built into Zed's DNA We've been dreaming of building the ultimate collaborative editor for years. The roots of this vision go back to Nathan's early days at Pivotal Labs , where pair programming with two keyboards plugged into the same computer was the standard practice. We set out to recreate that seamless collaboration experience\u2014but for distributed teams. But wait... doesn't this technology already exist in other editors? Yes! If you've been a developer long enough, you might recall the teletype package for Atom \u2014both built by Zed's founders. Teletype enabled developers to share \"portals\" into their workspaces, which was an initial step towards Zed's collaborative vision.

Our live payment processing platform was not impacted. No merchant funds or card numbers were accessed. We are donating the ransom amount to fund cybercrime research. Last week, Checkout.com was contacted by a criminal group known as \u201cShinyHunters\u201d, who claimed to have obtained data connected to Checkout.com and demanded a ransom. Upon investigation, we determined that this data was obtained by gaining unauthorized access to a legacy third-party cloud file storage system, used in 2020 and prior years. We estimate that this would affect less than 25% of our current merchant base. The system was used for internal operational documents and merchant onboarding materials at that time. This incident has not impacted our payment processing platform. The threat actors do not have, and never had, access to merchant funds or card numbers. The episode occurred when threat actors gained access to this third party legacy system which was not decommissioned properly. This was our mistake, and we take full responsibility. We are sorry.

Blender has been there for your projects, your learning, your art, your business. Today, we're asking for $5. That's it. If every active Blender user contributed $5 this month, Blender Foundation would meet its entire yearly funding goal for 2026. I already donated Remind me later Introducing an innovation space within the Blender project, where designers and developers can work together on challenging or future-facing projects, to keep Blender relevant in the years to come. Over the years, Blender has grown and matured into a powerful and complex piece of software. With its unstoppable release cycle, a massive, highly demanding, and diverse user community, natural technical debt, and complex technical dependencies, shipping new features and general improvements requires more and more effort and coordination. Software stability and reliability have become critical for individuals and companies. As a consequence, development efforts focus on those aspects, offering progressive improvements of existing functionality only when these are clear enhancements of what is already there. This makes it more challenging to innovate, think outside the box, experiment, and break things. To facilitate this essential aspect of product development, the Blender Foundation is establishing a new project: the Blender Lab. This is the innovation space where designers, developers, and researchers work together on challenging and future-facing projects that will help Blender stay relevant in the years to come.

For the Prosopo team, MongoDB Atlas was initially a fast, reliable way to run a cloud database, but as our data grew, so did the bills. Over the last year, we realised that we were spending thousands of dollars per month on infrastructure that we could run more efficiently ourselves. We explored various options but ultimately decided to migrate our MongoDB deployment to Hetzner, a cost-effective cloud provider. Here's how we managed to cut our costs by 90% without sacrificing performance or reliability. Starting with MongoDB Atlas for Free but Scaling Costs Added Up When we first started building, MongoDB Atlas was an easy choice. Everything was set up for us, and we could focus on building our application without worrying about database management. The free tier was sufficient for our initial needs, and as we grew, scaling up was as simple as a few clicks. However, scaling came with a steep price tag. We went from paying $0 per month for a small database to over $3,000 per month for a few hundred GBs of data. The cost breakdown before we migrated looked roughly like this: Service Monthly Cost Atlas M40 Instance - AWS $1000 Atlas Continuous Cloud Backup Storage $700 Atlas AWS Data Transfer (Same Region) $10 Atlas AWS Data Transfer (Different Region) $1 Atlas AWS Data Transfer (Internet) $1,000 \u2757 Total + VAT $3000+ The more keen eyed among you will have noticed the huge cost associated with data transfer over the internet - its as much as the servers! We're building Prosopo to be resilient to outages, such as the recent massive AWS outage , so we use many different cloud providers.

I got curious how easy it'd be to hack my Yaesu FT-70D, so I started doing some research. The only existing resource I could find for Yaesu radios was someone who posted about custom firmware for their Yaesu FT1DR . The Reddit poster mentioned that if you go through the firmware update process via USB, the radio exposes its Renesas H8SX microcontroller and can have its flash modified using the Renesas SDK. This was a great start and looked promising, but the SDK wasn't trivial to configure and I wasn't sure if it could even dump the firmware... so I didn't use it for very long. # Other Avenues Yaesu provides a Windows application on their website that can be used to update a radio's firmware over USB: The zip contains the following files: 1.2 MB Wed Nov 8 14:34:38 2017 FT-70D_ver111(USA).exe 682 KB Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 2017 FT-70DR_DE_Firmware_Update_Information_ENG_1711-B.pdf 8 MB Mon Apr 23 00:00:00 2018 FT-70DR_DE_MAIN_Firmware_Ver_Up_Manual_ENG_1804-B.pdf 3.2 MB Fri Jan 6 17:54:44 2012 HMSEUSBDRIVER.exe 160 KB Sat Sep 17 15:14:16 2011 RComms.dll 61 KB Tue Oct 23 17:02:08 2012 RFP_USB_VB.dll 1.7 MB Fri Mar 29 11:54:02 2013 vcredist_x86.exe I'm going to assume that the file specific to the FT-70D, \"FT-70D_ver111(USA).exe\", will likely contain our firmware image.

Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature --no-quarantine is used to forcibly bypass Gatekeeper, which is a built-in macOS security mechanism. This is used to run unsigned/unnotarized applications. macOS Tahoe is the final release to support Intel systems, and last year Apple updated macOS runtime protection to make it harder to override Gatekeeper. Macs with Apple silicon also don't \" permit native arm64 code to execute unless a valid signature is attached \". Finally, we are ending support for all casks that fail Gatekeeper checks on September 1st, 2026. With the above in mind, it's time to deprecate the --no-quarantine flag from brew . It intentionally bypasses macOS security mechanisms, which we already actively discourage. Deprecating now will give a decent lead time for users using it to come up with another solution or adjust their workflows. What is the motivation for the feature? Intel support is coming to an end from both Apple and Homebrew. This flag is primarily used to override a macOS security mechanism, which we do not want to encourage. Since we are requiring casks fulfill Gatekeeper checks next year, there is no reason to keep this flag. How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?

Information Author Gareth Dennis , A commuter train waits to leave the station somewhere in London, 18 May 2023. Photo: IMAGO / Pond5 Images Liberalization of the railways has been a key tenet of European transport policy since the early 2000s, with proponents claiming that competition results in improved service quality and increased ridership. This is an instantly disprovable statement given that ridership was already on the rise across Europe prior to, rather than after, liberalization efforts, suggesting other effects are at play. Gareth Dennis is an award-winning railway engineer and writer. He is the author of the internationally bestselling book How The Railways Will Fix the Future and co-founder of the Campaign for Level Boarding. On the other hand, the case against fragmented and privatized operations focuses on three key arguments. The first is that railways are complex systems where commercial boundaries at engineering interfaces are a threat to safety and efficiency. The second is that railway operations are geographic monopolies where market conditions are \u2014 at best \u2014 contrived. The third is that railways are a public service that cannot fail \u2014 hence, introducing private interests into the railways is merely a way to sequester income into private hands while the state shoulders the financial risk. In other words, private interests\u2019 role is simply to extract profit that could otherwise be reinvested into the system. The United Kingdom was one of first countries in Europe to liberalize a significant portion of its railways (Northern Ireland\u2019s railways remained publicly owned and operated). As such, the aftermath of privatization is instructive in tracing liberalization\u2019s final destination. In short\n\n[Content truncated...]",
