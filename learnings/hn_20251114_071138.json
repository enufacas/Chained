This was based on systematic evaluations showing cyber capabilities doubling in six months; we\u2019d also been tracking real-world cyberattacks, observing how malicious actors were using AI capabilities. While we predicted these capabilities would continue to evolve, what has stood out to us is how quickly they have done so at scale. In mid-September 2025, we detected suspicious activity that later investigation determined to be a highly sophisticated espionage campaign. The attackers used AI\u2019s \u201cagentic\u201d capabilities to an unprecedented degree\u2014using AI not just as an advisor, but to execute the cyberattacks themselves. The threat actor\u2014whom we assess with high confidence was a Chinese state-sponsored group\u2014manipulated our Claude Code tool into attempting infiltration into roughly thirty global targets and succeeded in a small number of cases. The operation targeted large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies. We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention. Upon detecting this activity, we immediately launched an investigation to understand its scope and nature. Over the following ten days, as we mapped the severity and full extent of the operation, we banned accounts as they were identified, notified affected entities as appropriate, and coordinated with authorities as we gathered actionable intelligence. This campaign has substantial implications for cybersecurity in the age of AI \u201cagents\u201d\u2014systems that can be run autonomously for long periods of time and that complete complex tasks largely independent of human intervention.

Best-effort maintenance will continue until March 2026. Afterward, there will be no further releases, no bugfixes, and no updates to resolve any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered. Existing deployments of Ingress NGINX will continue to function and installation artifacts will remain available. We recommend migrating to one of the many alternatives. Consider migrating to Gateway API , the modern replacement for Ingress. If you must continue using Ingress, many alternative Ingress controllers are listed in the Kubernetes documentation . Continue reading for further information about the history and current state of Ingress NGINX, as well as next steps. About Ingress NGINX Ingress is the original user-friendly way to direct network traffic to workloads running on Kubernetes. ( Gateway API is a newer way to achieve many of the same goals.) In order for an Ingress to work in your cluster, there must be an Ingress controller running. There are many Ingress controller choices available, which serve the needs of different users and use cases. Some are cloud-provider specific, while others have more general applicability. Ingress NGINX was an Ingress controller, developed early in the history of the Kubernetes project as an example implementation of the API. It became very popular due to its tremendous flexibility, breadth of features, and independence from any particular cloud or infrastructure provider. Since those days, many other Ingress controllers have been created within the Kubernetes project by community groups, and by cloud native vendors. Ingress NGINX has continued to be one of the most popular, deployed as part of many hosted Kubernetes platforms and within innumerable\n\n[Content truncated...]",

We not only debate their technical merits and aesthetic qualities, but they become integrated into our personal identities, along with the values and traits that we associate with them. Some even defend a form of Linguistic Determinism that thinking is confined to what the language makes typable. Since we spend so much time writing code, a keen interest in language design is justified. However, the character of these discussions suggests that we think of them as much more, and have perhaps forgotten their primary role. Programming languages are implementation tools for instructing machines, not thinking tools for expressing ideas. They are strict formal systems riddled with design compromises and practical limitations. At the end of the day, we hope they make controlling computers bearable for humans. In contrast, thoughts are best expressed through a medium which is free and flexible. Thinking in Math The natural language which has been effectively used for thinking about computation, for thousands of years, is mathematics. Most people don\u2019t think of math as free or flexible. They think of scary symbols and memorizing steps to regurgitate on tests. Others hear math and think category theory, lambda calculus, or other methods of formalizing computation itself, but these are hardly necessary for programming itself.

Blender has been there for your projects, your learning, your art, your business. Today, we're asking for $5. That's it.

I already donated Remind me later Introducing an innovation space within the Blender project, where designers and developers can work together on challenging or future-facing projects, to keep Blender relevant in the years to come. Over the years, Blender has grown and matured into a powerful and complex piece of software. With its unstoppable release cycle, a massive, highly demanding, and diverse user community, natural technical debt, and complex technical dependencies, shipping new features and general improvements requires more and more effort and coordination. Software stability and reliability have become critical for individuals and companies. As a consequence, development efforts focus on those aspects, offering progressive improvements of existing functionality only when these are clear enhancements of what is already there. This makes it more challenging to innovate, think outside the box, experiment, and break things. To facilitate this essential aspect of product development, the Blender Foundation is establishing a new project: the Blender Lab. This is the innovation space where designers, developers, and researchers work together on challenging and future-facing projects that will help Blender stay relevant in the years to come.

It\u2019s an accomplishment that will help the new rocket system become an option to send larger payloads to space, the moon, and beyond. Thursday\u2019s launch wasn\u2019t just about the landing attempt, though. Roughly 34 minutes after takeoff, the upper stage of New Glenn successfully deployed the rocket\u2019s first commercial payload: twin spacecraft for NASA that will travel to Mars to study the red planet\u2019s atmosphere.

New Glenn finally made it to the launch pad on Sunday, but weather and solar storms delayed it further. The rocket finally took off from Launch Complex 36 in Cape Canaveral, Florida on Thursday at around 3:55 p.m. ET.

      "content": "Heartbeats in Distributed Systems Arpit Bhayani curious, tinkerer, and explorer In distributed systems, one of the fundamental challenges is knowing whether a node or service is alive and functioning properly. Unlike monolithic applications, where everything runs in a single process, distributed systems span multiple machines, networks, and data centers. This becomes even glaring when the nodes are geographically separated. This is where heartbeat mechanisms come into play. Imagine a cluster of servers working together to process millions of requests per day. If one server silently crashes, how quickly can the system detect this failure and react? How do we distinguish between a truly dead server and one that is just temporarily slow due to network congestion? These questions form the core of why heartbeat mechanisms matter. What are Heartbeat Messages At its most basic level, a heartbeat is a periodic signal sent from one component in a distributed system to another to indicate that the sender is still alive and functioning. Think of it as a simple message that says \u201cI am alive!\u201d Heartbeat messages are typically small and lightweight, often containing just a timestamp, a sequence number, or an identifier. The key characteristic is that they are sent regularly at fixed intervals, creating a predictable pattern that other components can monitor. The mechanism works through a simple contract between two parties: the sender and the receiver. The sender commits to broadcasting its heartbeat at regular intervals, say every 2 seconds. The receiver monitors these incoming heartbeats and maintains a record of when the last heartbeat was received. If the receiver does not hear from the sender within an expected timeframe, it can reasonably assume something has gone wrong. class HeartbeatSender : def __init__ (self, interval_seconds): self .interval = interval_seconds self .sequence_number = 0 def send_heartbeat (self, target): message = { 'node_id' : self .get_node_id(), 'ti\n\n[Content truncated...]",
