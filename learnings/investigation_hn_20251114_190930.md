**Score**: 232 upvotes  
**URL**: https://www.levs.fyi/blog/2-years-of-ml-vs-1-month-of-prompting/

**Why It Matters**: This is a **real-world case study** demonstrating the practical superiority of LLMs over traditional ML for certain tasks.

**Key Technical Details**:

1. **The Problem**: Warranty claim classification at Honda
   - Thousands of claims daily
   - Natural language descriptions
   - Need to categorize into actionable problems
   - SQL queries become unmaintainable

2. **Traditional ML Approach (2023)**:
   - 2-year project timeline
   - Required establishing "ground truth"
   - Different mental models across team members
   - Model accuracy issues
   - Deployment complexity

3. **LLM Approach (2024)**:
   - 1-month project timeline
   - GPT-4 with prompting
   - Handled context and nuance naturally
   - Production-ready immediately
   - Superior accuracy

4. **Example from Content**:
   ```
   Claim: "Customer reports oil on driveway, thought engine leak. 
           Detailed inspection found no engine leaks. Traced oil to 
           spill during last oil change."
   
   SQL Query: Would incorrectly flag as engine leak (matches "leak" + "oil")
   ML Model: Struggled with negations and context
   LLM: Correctly identified as service issue, not vehicle defect
   ```

**Implications for Chained**:
- ✅ Validate our LLM-first agent architecture
- ✅ Quick iteration is advantage (1 month vs 2 years)
- ✅ Natural language understanding is killer feature
- ✅ Focus on prompting expertise over model training

**Lesson**: Practical success trumps theoretical perfection. Ship and iterate.
