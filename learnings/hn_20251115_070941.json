Nevermind the freshly baked pound cakes under Tupperware domes like trophies, which she kept atop the washing machine, also in the kitchen, or the biscuits she could whip up with nary a measuring device or recipe. I would learn to appreciate all those later. As a kid, the cheese wowed me. My mother tried to explain that it was a commodity provided by government funding for the school cafeteria where my grandmother worked. \u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t mention the cheese,\u201d Mom said recently, when I told her about writing this story.

The backlog of events we needed to process from that outage on the 20th stretched our system to the limits, and so we decided to increase our headroom for event handling throughput. When we attempted that infrastructure upgrade on October 23rd, we ran into yet another race condition bug in Aurora RDS. This is the story of how we figured out it was an AWS bug (later confirmed by AWS) and what we learned. Background The Hightouch Events product enables organizations to gather and centralize user behavioral data such as page views, clicks, and purchases. Customers can setup syncs to load events into a cloud data warehouse for analytics or stream them directly to marketing, operational, and analytics tools to support real-time personalization use cases. Here is the portion of Hightouch\u2019s architecture dedicated to our events system: Hightouch events system architecture Our system scales on three levers: Kubernetes clusters that contain event collectors and batch workers, Kafka for event processing, and Postgres as our virtual queue metadata store. When our pagers went off during the AWS outage on the 20th, we observed: Services were unable to connect to Kafka brokers managed by AWS MSK. Services struggled to autoscale because we couldn\u2019t provision new EC2 nodes. Customer functions for realtime data transformation were unavailable due to AWS STS errors, which caused our retry queues to balloon in size. Kafka\u2019s durability meant that no events were dropped once they were accepted by the collectors, but there was a massive backlog to process. Syncs with consistently high traffic or with enrichments that needed to call slower 3rd party services took longer to catch up and were testing the limits of our (small) Postgres instance\u2019s ability to act as a queue for the batch metadata.

For me it was good because I learned a lot. At some point we needed a monitoring solution, and Zabbix didn\u2019t fit well into the new and declarative world of containers and Docker. I was tasked to find a solution. I looked at Loki/Prometheus with Grafana and Elastic with Kibana. Elastic was a beast! Heavy, hard to run, resource-hungry, and complex, Loki and Prometheus were the perfect fit back then. So I created a docker-compose.yaml with Loki, Prometheus and Grafana. Since they all had the internal Docker network, we required no auth between them. Grafana was only exposed over an SSH tunnel. One static scrape config and the Docker Loki log plugin later, we had our observability stack. For non-Docker logs, we used Promtail. Loki and Prometheus stayed on the same machine and all we required was a local volume mount. Load was minimal. \u2139\ufe0f This is when I learned that you should not transform every log parameter to an label just to make it easier to select in the Grafana UI. Having a label for latency with basically limitless values will fill every disks inodes, thats just how Cortex bin-packs. I also found out Grafana Labs has a cloud offering with a nice free tier. So I even used this for personal stuff. I had a good experience with them. Time goes on, and I switched jobs. Now we have Kubernetes. The Prometheus container was now switching nodes.

It's unfortunately no longer enough to force websites to check your government-issued ID before you can access certain content, because politicians have now discovered that people are using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to protect their privacy and bypass these invasive laws. Their solution? Entirely ban the use of VPNs. Yes, really. As of this writing, Wisconsin lawmakers are escalating their war on privacy by targeting VPNs in the name of \u201cprotecting children\u201d in A.B. 105 / S.B. 130 . It\u2019s an age verification bill that requires all websites distributing material that could conceivably be deemed \u201csexual content\u201d to both implement an age verification system and also to block the access of users connected via VPN. The bill seeks to broadly expand the definition of materials that are \u201charmful to minors\u201d beyond the type of speech that states can prohibit minors from accessing\u2014potentially encompassing things like depictions and discussions of human anatomy, sexuality, and reproduction. This follows a notable pattern: As we\u2019ve explained previously , lawmakers, prosecutors, and activists in conservative states have worked for years to aggressively expand the definition of \u201charmful to minors\u201d to censor a broad swath of content: diverse educational materials , sex education resources , art, and even award-winning literature . Wisconsin\u2019s bill has already passed the State Assembly and is now moving through the Senate. If it becomes law, Wisconsin could become the first state where using a VPN to access certain content is banned. Michigan lawmakers have proposed similar legislation that did not move through its legislature, but among other things, would force internet providers to actively monitor and block VPN connections.

In this article I want to show you some interesting technical facts I learned about AWK. Lack of GC AWK was designed to not require a GC (garbage collector) for its implementation. By the way, just like sh/bash. (I learned this remarkable fact from the oilshell blog \u2013 rather interesting technical blog, where author describes his progress in creating the \u201cbetter bash\u201d). The most substantial consequence is that it\u2019s forbidden to return an array from a function, you can return only a scalar value. function f () { a [ 1 ] = 2 return a # error } However, you can pass an array to a function and fill it there BEGIN { fill ( arr ) print arr [ 0 ] \" \" arr [ 1 ] } function fill ( arr , i ) { arr [ i ++ ] = \"hello\" ; arr [ i ++ ] = \"world\" } The thing is, in a lack of GC all heap allocations must be deterministic. That is, array, declared locally in a function must be destroyed at the moment when function returns. That\u2019s why it\u2019s disallowed to escape the declaration scope of a function (via return). The absense of GC allows to keep the language implementation very simple, thus fast and portable. Also, with predictable memory consumption. To me, this qualifies AWK as perfect embeddable language, although, for some reason this niche is firmly occupied by (GC-equipped) Lua. Local variables All variables are global by default. However, if you add a variable to the function parameters (like i above) it becomes local. JavaScript works in a similar way, although there are more suitable var / let / const keywords. In practice, it is customary to separate \u201creal\u201d function parameters from \u201clocal\u201d parameters with additional spaces for clarity. Although Brian Kernighan (the K in AWK) regrets this design, in practice it works just fine. The notation for function locals is appalling (all my faul\n\n[Content truncated...]",

Everyone has experienced being broke. Being broke sucks. You are watching every dollar spent, finding ways to trim or make things stretch until the next payday. The difference is when you are broke you have some money . You can afford to put gas in your car, but not enough to do that repair. Money is tight, but you can get the basics at the grocery store. You can\u2019t afford to go to the movies, but will stay home and watch what\u2019s new on Netflix. When you are poor that next payday brings no relief. It is like an endless runner game. No matter how fast you run or how high you jump you can never see the finish line. No matter how tired you are the ground keeps moving. There is no room for errors as the punishment for mistakes is astronomical. When you hit an obstacle you don\u2019t restart from the last checkpoint, you go back to the beginning. There is this mindset from folks that poor people must not be smart. I mean, you\u2019re smart and you\u2019re not poor! The problem must be a skill issue! Learn the skills to do it yourself and you\u2019ll be able to pull yourself up. The other mindset is poor people are lazy. Quit complaining and do it yourself! Just get a better job! Get a second job! There\u2019s money out there, you just have to go get it. The last is these folks think they understand what it is like to be poor. Hey, I was a broke college student and I get being poor! I had a rough patch, it will pass. Let\u2019s start at the top. I have a van that is falling apart.

We released Go 1.24 in February and Go 1.25 in August , following our now well-established and dependable release cadence. Continuing our mission to build the most productive language platform for building production systems, these releases included new APIs for building robust and reliable software, significant advances in Go\u2019s track record for building secure software, and some serious under-the-hood improvements. Meanwhile, no one can ignore the seismic shifts in our industry brought by generative AI. The Go team is applying its thoughtful and uncompromising mindset to the problems and opportunities of this dynamic space, working to bring Go\u2019s production-ready approach to building robust AI integrations, products, agents, and infrastructure. Core language and library improvements First released in Go 1.24 as an experiment and then graduated in Go 1.25, the new testing/synctest package significantly simplifies writing tests for concurrent, asynchronous code . Such code is particularly common in network services, and is traditionally very hard to test well. The synctest package works by virtualizing time itself. It takes tests that used to be slow, flaky, or both, and makes them easy to rewrite into reliable and nearly instantaneous tests, often with just a couple extra lines of code. It\u2019s also a great example of Go\u2019s integrated approach to software development: behind an almost trivial API, the synctest package hides a deep integration with the Go runtime and other parts of the standard library. This isn\u2019t the only boost the testing package got over the past year. The new testing.B.Loop API is both easier to use than the original testing.B.N API and addresses many of the traditional\u2014and often invisible!\u2014 pitfalls of writing Go benchmarks.
