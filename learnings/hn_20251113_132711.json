Categories Company News Tl;dr: Last week, we were targeted by a criminal extortion attempt. The attackers gained access to a legacy, third-party cloud file storage system. Our live payment processing platform was not impacted. No merchant funds or card numbers were accessed. We are donating the ransom amount to fund cybercrime research. Last week, Checkout.com was contacted by a criminal group known as \u201cShinyHunters\u201d, who claimed to have obtained data connected to Checkout.com and demanded a ransom. Upon investigation, we determined that this data was obtained by gaining unauthorized access to a legacy third-party cloud file storage system, used in 2020 and prior years. We estimate that this would affect less than 25% of our current merchant base. The system was used for internal operational documents and merchant onboarding materials at that time. This incident has not impacted our payment processing platform. The threat actors do not have, and never had, access to merchant funds or card numbers. The episode occurred when threat actors gained access to this third party legacy system which was not decommissioned properly. This was our mistake, and we take full responsibility. We are sorry. We regret that this incident has caused worry for our partners and people. We have begun the process to identify and contact those impacted and are\n\n[Content truncated...]",

Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature --no-quarantine is used to forcibly bypass Gatekeeper, which is a built-in macOS security mechanism. This is used to run unsigned/unnotarized applications. macOS Tahoe is the final release to support Intel systems, and last year Apple updated macOS runtime protection to make it harder to override Gatekeeper. Macs with Apple silicon also don't \" permit native arm64 code to execute unless a valid signature is attached \". Finally, we are ending support for all casks that fail Gatekeeper checks on September 1st, 2026. With the above in mind, it's time to deprecate the --no-quarantine flag from brew . It intentionally bypasses macOS security mechanisms, which we already actively discourage. Deprecating now will give a decent lead time for users using it to come up with another solution or adjust their workflows. What is the motivation for the feature? Intel support is coming to an end from both Apple and Homebrew. This flag is primarily used to override a macOS security mechanism, which we do not want to encourage. Since we are requiring casks fulfill Gatekeeper checks next year, there is no reason to keep this flag. How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users? We will provide a safer experience for our users, and stop making it easier to bypass OS-leve\n\n[Content truncated...]",

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems. The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context. Who are the problems aimed at? The intended audience include students for whom the basic curriculum is not feeding their hunger to learn, adults whose background was not primarily mathematics but had an interest in things mathematical, and professionals who want to keep their problem solving and mathematics on the cutting edge. Currently we have 1365127 registered members who have solved at least one problem, representing 220 locations throughout the world, and collectively using 113 different programming languages to solve the problems. Can anyone solve the problems? The problems range in difficulty and for many the experience is inductive chain learning. That is, by solving one problem it will expose you to a new concept that may allow you to undertake a previously inaccessible problem. So determined participants will be able to slowly but surely work their way through the problems. What next?

Mergiraf is a merge-conflict resolver that uses a generic algorithm plus a small amount of language-specific knowledge to solve conflicts that Git's default strategy cannot. The project's contributors have been working on the tool for just under a year, but it already supports 33 languages , including C, Python, Rust, and even SystemVerilog . Mergiraf was started by Antonin Delpeuch, but several other contributors have stepped up to help, of which Ada Alakbarova is the most prolific. The project is written in Rust and licensed under version 3 of the GPL. The default Git merge algorithm (\"ort\") is primarily line-based. It does include some tree-based logic for merging directories, but changes within a single file are merged on a line-by-line basis. That can lead to situations where two logically separate changes that affect the same line cause a merge conflict. Consider the following base version: void callback(int status); And then suppose that one person makes the function fallible: int callback(int status); While someone else changes the argument type: void callback(long status); The default merge algorithm can't handle that, because there are conflicting changes to the same line. Syntax-aware merging, however, is based on the syntactical elements of the language, not individual lines. So, for example, Mergiraf can resolve the above conflict like this: int callback(long status); From its point of view, the changes don't actually overlap, because the return type and the argument type are treated as separate, no\n\n[Content truncated...]",

World models should reconstruct, generate, and simulate 3D worlds; and allow both humans and agents to interact with them. Spatially intelligent world models will transform a wide variety of industries over the coming years. Two months ago we shared a preview of Marble , our World Model that creates 3D worlds from image or text prompts. Since then, Marble has been available to an early set of beta users to create 3D worlds for themselves. Today we are making Marble, a first-in-class generative multimodal world model, generally available for anyone to use. We have also drastically expanded Marble's capabilities, and are excited to highlight them here: Multimodal Marble : Marble is now massively multimodal. Marble can create 3D worlds from text, images, video, or coarse 3D layouts; Marble also lets you interactively edit, expand, and combine worlds. Once generated, 3D worlds can be exported as Gaussian splats, meshes, or videos. These new capabilities let users create and edit worlds with fine-grained control; and makes those worlds more useful than ever before. Marble Labs : We are launching Marble Labs , a creative hub where imagination meets experimentation. It is where artists, engineers, and designers push the boundaries of world models, showcasing bold ideas, real-world workflows, and new possibilities across gaming, VFX, design, robotics, and beyond. Marble Labs is also home to in-depth case studies, tutorials, and documentation that give anyone the tools to learn, build, and share their own 3D worlds.

In an analysis of more than 6,800 colon cancer patients across all University of California Health sites, researchers found that those taking glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) medications were less than half as likely to die within five years compared to those who weren\u2019t on the drugs (15.5% vs. 37.1%). The study, led by Raphael Cuomo , Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and member of UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, used real-world clinical data from the University of California Health Data Warehouse to assess outcomes across the state\u2019s academic medical centers. After adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), disease severity and other health factors, GLP-1 users still showed significantly lower odds of death, suggesting a strong and independent protective effect. The survival benefit appeared most pronounced in patients with very high BMI (over 35), hinting that GLP-1 drugs may help counteract the inflammatory and metabolic conditions that worsen colon cancer prognosis. Researchers believe several biological mechanisms could explain the link. Beyond regulating blood sugar, GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce systemic inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss \u2014 all factors that can dampen tumor-promot\n\n[Content truncated...]",

The online version has been available since 2001, and now there is also a throughly revised version available in book form . We wanted to do two things with this course. First, we wanted to provide a text that was relatively self contained, a text that would permit someone with little or no knowledge of computing to pick up the basics of Prolog with the minimum of fuss. We also wanted the text to be clear enough to make it useful for self study. We believe that if you read the text, and do the associated exercises, you will gain a useful partial entry to the world of Prolog. But only a partial entry, and this brings us to our second point. We want to emphasize the practical aspects of Prolog. Prolog is something you do. You can't learn a programming language simply by reading about it, and if you really want to get the most out of this course, we strongly advise you to get hold of a Prolog interpreter (you'll find pointers to some nice ones on this website) and work through all the Practical Sessions that we provide.
