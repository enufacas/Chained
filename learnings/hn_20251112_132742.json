LeCun, a Turing Award-winning pioneer of modern AI, has begun early fundraising discussions for his new venture, which will focus on developing \"world models,\" next-generation systems designed to learn from visual and spatial data rather than text. These models aim to replicate human reasoning and understanding of the physical world, a project LeCun has said could take a decade to mature. LeCun's exit comes amid an internal overhaul of Meta's AI strategy. Zuckerberg has shifted Meta's Fundamental AI Research Lab - FAIR, which LeCun founded in 2013, away from long-term research toward commercial AI products and large language models - LLMs. The move follows the underwhelming release of Meta's Llama 4 model, which lagged behind rival offerings from Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI. To accelerate progress, Zuckerberg recently hired Alexandr Wang, founder of Scale AI, paying $14.3 billion for a 49 percent stake in his company and appointing him to lead Meta's new Superintelligence division, to which LeCun now reports. The CEO also formed an elite team called TBD Lab, offering $100 million pay packages to lure top AI talent from competitors.

Sunspot region 4274 produced its strongest solar flare thus far since it appeared on the east limb and the sixth strongest solar flare of the current solar cycle. An impressive long duration and highly eruptive X5.1 (R3-strong) solar flare peaked this morning at 10:04 UTC. It became quickly clear that the eruption would be followed by an impressive coronal mass ejection (CME). The resulting coronal wave following the solar explosion as well as the coronal dimming observed as the CME was propelled into space were of a spectacular magnitude as can be seen in the animation below provided by halocme . Another eruption from AR12474, associated with an X5.1 flare. It has become a full halo CME. I am truly impressed by how fast and global this coronal wave is. The CME will arrive on November 13, but because of earlier CMEs it will be challenging to isolate the ICME from this. pic.twitter.com/H6eNjzQUGz \u2014 Halo CME (@halocme) November 11, 2025 Taking a look at coronagraph imagery provided by GOES-19 CCOR-1 we see the gorgeous fast halo coronal mass ejection as it propagates away from the Sun. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that this plasma cloud of course has an earth-directed component and it is pretty clear that this will be a strong impact when it arrives at our planet. This rightfully so prompted the NOAA SWPC to issue a G4 or greater geomagnetic storm watch for tomorrow as the cloud could impact our planet as early as 16 UTC on 12 November. Not only is the CME fast but it will also travel trough an area with high ambient solar wind speed and low density thanks to two other CMEs released earlier by this region. More about that below.

The new Bluetooth Core 6.2 specification also introduces various BLE Test Mode enhancements. If you feel like Bluetooth specifications are released more often than in the past, that\u2019s normal because the Bluetooth SIG switched to a bi-annual release schedule. For instance, the Bluetooth 6.1 specification was just published last May, or about 6 months ago\u2026 Bluetooth 6.2 highlights: Bluetooth Shorter Connection Intervals (SCI) reduce the minimum Bluetooth LE connection interval from 7.5 ms to just 375 \u00b5s for faster responsiveness. The change will especially impact high-performance HID devices, real-time human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and latency-sensitive sensors. AR/VR and gaming applications will particularly benefit from the lower latency. Bluetooth Channel Sounding Amplitude-based Attack Resilience adds protections against sophisticated amplitude-based RF attacks. Devices for the automotive, smart home, and industrial markets will become less prone to relay and spoofing threats with the changes.

      "content": "diamond geezer Tuesday, November 11, 2025 There are many places around the City of London to see its old Roman Wall , notably alongside Noble Street, in Barber Surgeons' Meadow, through the Barbican, in St Alphage Garden and just outside the entrance to Tower Hill station. Here are four of the odder spots. Four strange places to see London's Roman Wall 1) From platform 1 at Tower Hill station If you're ever waiting for a westbound train at Tower Hill station, take a walk to the rear of the platform and take a look across the tracks, roughly where the penultimate carriage would stop. High on the far wall is a square recess lined by black tiles, and at the back of that is a dimly-lit surface of chunky irregular blocks. Unlike every single other thing on the Underground, the Romans built that. London's original wall was 2 miles long, 6 metres high and almost 3 metres thick at its base, all the better to keep out uncivilised marauders. It was built around 200 AD, then left to decay and rebuilt in the medieval era, again for defensive purposes. This is one of the original bits, not that you can easily tell by squinting across the tracks. A small metal lamp points inwards but is no longer switched on because heritage illumination is not a TfL priority. There is however a rather nice silver plaque on the pillar opposite, should you step back far enough to notice it. The plaque confirms that the stones here are a continuation of the wall seen (much more clearly) outside. What it doesn't mention is the unavoidable truth that the wall must once have continued across the tracks and platforms but is no longer here. That's because when the Circle line was constructed in 1882 the railway companies had permission to demolish 22 metres of London's wall and duly did, the Victorians never being afraid to destroy ancient heritage. Ian Visits has a photo of navvies standing atop the offending stonework just before they bashed it through. The square hole is no recompense, plus you can't\n\n[Content truncated...]"

It is an early build with rough edges, but it proves the point: MAUI can now run on every major desktop OS and in the browser. What is the Avalonia MAUI Backend? At its core, the Avalonia MAUI Backend enables you to keep your MAUI codebase while replacing the rendering layer with Avalonia. The goal is straightforward: take your existing MAUI applications and extend them to additional platforms, while enhancing desktop performance along the way. In practical terms, that means several big wins. Desktop Linux support .NET MAUI apps running as first class desktop apps on distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora, sharing the same Avalonia renderer that already powers demanding desktop apps in production today. Embedded Linux Avalonia already runs on embedded Linux devices, from Raspberry Pi panels to industrial HMIs. Using the same backend, the Avalonia MAUI Backend brings those capabilities to MAUI as well, so the applications you build in MAUI can run on the same embedded Linux targets as Avalonia. WebAssembly support The demo you can open in your browser today is a real MAUI application running on WebAssembly, rendered by Avalonia, with no native dependencies on the client. It is an early build, but it demonstrates what is now possible. MAUI apps will soon be free to deploy to the browser. Bonus: The Avalonia MAUI Backend runs on Windows a\n\n[Content truncated...]"

I opened it and I saw that it has updated to Goodnotes 6. I looked through the changelogs, and what? There are AI-integrated features now, which, as far as I\u2019m aware, can\u2019t be turned off. 1 And the option to buy a lifetime license? Gone. I bought the previous \u201clifetime\u201d version of the app, but for WHAT, since I have to pay for the subscription to access the newest features. Sure, I can switch back to the outdated version, but if I had known this would happen, I would\u2019ve just gone for the yearly subscription (even though I try to avoid them). It would\u2019ve been cheaper anyway. Sadly, everything is going in this direction. You can have a subscription for almost everything now. From food delivery apps to beer subscription. Companies prey on those who forget to cancel their free trial. So far, it only happened once to me, but thankfully, I managed to get my refund. But not everyone might feel like going through the refund process, because companies make it intentionally hard by creating friction - hiding it deep into their websites or adding extra unnecessary steps like forcing you to reach out to the support. People might just sigh, mutter \u201cthis bloody subscription rahhh,\u201d and cancel it so it won\u2019t charge them again. It\u2019s funny how \u201cownership\u201d in the digital world has become an illusion. You don\u2019t really own your apps, your music, or even your tools anymore. You\u2019re just renting access until someone decides to move the paywall. It\u2019s convenient, sure, but it also feels like losing control over something that used to be ours. Market values steady revenue streams over fair ownership. The subscription model rewards companies not for making better products, but for finding better ways to keep us paying indefinitely. They won\u2019t disappear, not unless they find something more profitable. Maybe they\u2019ll start suckin\n\n[Content truncated...]"

      "content": "My Fan Worked Fine, So I Gave it WiFi 3 November 2025 I designed a fully revertible modification for a Vornado 633DC fan so I could control it remotely over WiFi. The final result is concealed entirely within the fan\u2019s housing, leaving no visible modification. If you\u2019re interested in building one yourself, the schematic, BoM , and PCB design are all available here . In terms of firmware, I used ESPHome with an external component, for which the source code is available here . The rest of this post covers the research and development that went into the project. The underside of the modified fan, boasting a larger, more advanced PCB than the original. How it began When I first bought this fan I chose it because it uses a DC motor which, compared to AC counterparts, use less power, and run quieter. By adding a smart plug between it and a power outlet, I could give it a basic form of on/off remote control. But this presented a problem: If I wanted to adjust the speed I would have to physically interact with the fan! Obviously, I needed to see what could be done about this, and so I took a look at the inside of the fan. Six screws later, and I was greeted with a surprisingly spacious interior. Inside were two components: An AC-DC converter A small PCB which held the potentiometer used for the speed control dial Everything joined up via a 2-pin and 5-pin connector on the PCB. From there, it was a straightforward matter of measuring voltages and continuity to work out what connected to what: the 2-pin connector was offering 24V DC. The 5-pin connector was what went off to the motor itself. Two of its pins were passing through the 24V DC and ground directly. Two more pins were connected to the potentiometer. The fifth pin was not connected. With this, I concluded that the variable resistance between the two potentiometer pins is used to control the speed of the motor. From here the idea started to form: if I could produce a variable resistance digitally, I could control it r\n\n[Content truncated...]"

If you want, you can jump right to the image comparisons , or the conclusion , but promise us you won\u2019t presumptuous comments on Hacker News until you\u2019ve also read the background! Background Hi! We\u2019re LateNiteSoft, and we\u2019ve been working on photography-related iOS apps for 15 years now. Working on market-leading apps such as Camera+, Photon and REC , we\u2019ve always had our finger on the pulse on what users want out of their mobile photography. With the ground-breaking release of OpenAI\u2019s gpt-image-1 image generation model earlier this year, we started investigating all the interesting use cases we could think of for AI image editing. But as a company that has never taken any venture capital investment, all our products have to pay for themselves. We\u2019re in it to delight our users, not just capture market share and sell them out. When considering AI projects, one thing has been clear \u2013 we can\u2019t take the AI startup road where you have a generous free tier, charge an unreasonably small monthly fee for \u201cunlimited\u201d, and hope you\u2019re going to make it up on scale (code for \u201csomeone please acquire us\u201d). All the AI-focused billing systems we could find out there were based on this. Assuming you want to claim unlimited access, and then sandbag users with \u201cfair use\u201d clauses and prevent them from any actual unlimited usage (which is, obviously, untenable, since you\u2019ll end up with one $20/mo user reselling to everyone else). Since we want to fairly charge our customers for what they actually use, we\u2019ve built a credit-based \u201cpay per generation\u201d-style billing system (that internally we\u2019ve been calling CreditProxy). We\u2019ve also been planning on providing this as a service, since nobody else seems to be doing it, so if you\u2019r\n\n[Content truncated...]"
