See\nGranting access to GitHub Copilot for members of your organization\n.\nIf a user receives a seat from multiple organizations in the same enterprise, the enterprise will be billed only once, and one organization is selected and billed for the seat. To determine which organization is billed for a given user, request a detailed usage report and refer to the\norganization\ncolumn for the user's Copilot license. See\nBilling reports reference\n.\nBilling cycles\nBilled users are calculated at the end of each billing cycle, based on the number of GitHub Copilot seats that are assigned.
