Sunspot region 4274 produced its strongest solar flare thus far since it appeared on the east limb and the sixth strongest solar flare of the current solar cycle. An impressive long duration and highly eruptive X5.1 (R3-strong) solar flare peaked this morning at 10:04 UTC.\nIt became quickly clear that the eruption would be followed by an impressive coronal mass ejection (CME). The resulting coronal wave following the solar explosion as well as the coronal dimming observed as the CME was propelled into space were of a spectacular magnitude as can be seen in the animation below provided by\nhalocme\n.\nAnother eruption from AR12474, associated with an X5.1 flare. It has become a full halo CME. I am truly impressed by how fast and global this coronal wave is. The CME will arrive on November 13, but because of earlier CMEs it will be challenging to isolate the ICME from this.\npic.twitter.com/H6eNjzQUGz\n\u2014 Halo CME (@halocme)\nNovember 11, 2025\nTaking a look at coronagraph imagery provided by GOES-19 CCOR-1 we see the gorgeous fast halo coronal mass ejection as it propagates away from the Sun. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that this plasma cloud of course has an earth-directed component and it is pretty clear that this will be a strong impact when it arrives at our planet. This rightfully so prompted the NOAA SWPC to issue a G4 or greater geomagnetic storm watch for tomorrow as the cloud could impact our planet as early as 16 UTC on 12 November. Not only is the CME fast but it will also travel trough an area with high ambient solar wind speed and low density thanks to two other CMEs released earlier by this region.

What started as an experiment has grown into a project we are committing to, with apps already running on new platforms. It is time to show you what we have been building.\nTry It Right Now\nBefore we dive into the details, you can experience it yourself:\nLaunch MAUI in your browser \u00e2\u0086\u0092\nThis is a real MAUI application running on WebAssembly, rendered through Avalonia, with no plugins or hidden tricks. It is an early build with rough edges, but it proves the point: MAUI can now run on every major desktop OS and in the browser.\nWhat is the Avalonia MAUI Backend?\nAt its core, the Avalonia MAUI Backend enables you to keep your MAUI codebase while replacing the rendering layer with Avalonia. The goal is straightforward: take your existing MAUI applications and extend them to additional platforms, while enhancing desktop performance along the way.\nIn practical terms, that means several big wins.\nDesktop Linux support\n.NET MAUI apps running as first class desktop apps on distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora, sharing the same Avalonia renderer that already powers demanding desktop apps in production today.\nEmbedded Linux\nAvalonia already runs on embedded Linux devices, from Raspberry Pi panels to industrial HMIs. Using the same backend, the Avalonia MAUI Backend brings those capabilities to MAUI as well, so the applications you build in MAUI can run on the same embedded Linux targets as Avalonia.\nWebAssembly support\nThe demo you can open in your browser today is a real MAUI application running on WebAssembly, rendered by Avalonia, with no native dependencies on the client. It is an early build, but it demonstrates what is now possible. MAUI apps will soon be free to deploy to the browser.\nBonus: The Avalonia MAUI Backend runs on Windows\n\n[Content truncated...]"

Here are four of the odder spots.\nFour strange places to see London's Roman Wall\n1) From platform 1 at Tower Hill station\nIf you're ever waiting for a westbound train at Tower Hill station, take a walk to the rear of the platform and take a look across the tracks, roughly where the penultimate carriage would stop. High on the far wall is a square recess lined by black tiles, and at the back of that is a dimly-lit surface of chunky irregular blocks. Unlike every single other thing on the Underground, the Romans built that.\nLondon's original wall was 2 miles long, 6 metres high and almost 3 metres thick at its base, all the better to keep out uncivilised marauders. It was built around 200 AD, then left to decay and rebuilt in the medieval era, again for defensive purposes. This is one of the original bits, not that you can easily tell by squinting across the tracks. A small metal lamp points inwards but is no longer switched on because heritage illumination is not a TfL priority. There is however a rather nice silver plaque on the pillar opposite, should you step back far enough to notice it.\nThe plaque confirms that the stones here are a continuation of the wall seen (much more clearly) outside. What it doesn't mention is the unavoidable truth that the wall must once have continued across the tracks and platforms but is no longer here. That's because when the Circle line was constructed in 1882 the railway companies had permission to demolish 22 metres of London's wall and duly did, the Victorians never being afraid to destroy ancient heritage.\nIan Visits\nhas a photo of navvies standing atop the offending stonework just before they bashed it through.

By adding a smart plug between it and a power outlet, I could give it a basic form of on/off remote control. But this presented a problem: If I wanted to adjust the speed I would have to physically interact with the fan!\nObviously, I needed to see what could be done about this, and so I took a look at the inside of the fan. Six screws later, and I was greeted with a surprisingly spacious interior.\nInside were two components:\nAn AC-DC converter\nA small PCB which held the potentiometer used for the speed control dial\nEverything joined up via a 2-pin and 5-pin connector on the PCB. From there, it was a straightforward matter of measuring voltages and continuity to work out what connected to what: the 2-pin connector was offering 24V DC. The 5-pin connector was what went off to the motor itself. Two of its pins were passing through the 24V DC and ground directly. Two more pins were connected to the potentiometer. The fifth pin was not connected.\nWith this, I concluded that the variable resistance between the two potentiometer pins is used to control the speed of the motor.

It\u2019s often useful to have someone give you directions, point out gas stations, and recommend stops for snacks. This is a helpful amount of collaboration.\nAn unhelpful amount of collaboration is getting out of your car to ask pedestrians if they like your car, swapping drivers every 10 minutes, or having someone constantly commenting on your driving.\nIn the first scenario, you get the right amount of feedback to get to your destination as fast as possible. In the second, you get more feedback, but it slows you down. You run the risk of not making it to the place you want to go.\nThe second scenario is also the one most startups (or companies, really) end up in because of \u2728 collaboration \u2728.\nBeing good at feedback means knowing when not to give it\nAs PostHog grows, I\u2019ve seen more and more collaboration that doesn\u2019t add value or adds far too little value for the time lost collaborating.

We aim to hire people who are great at their jobs and get out of their way. No deadlines, minimal coordination, and no managers telling you what to do.\nIn return, we ask for extraordinarily high ownership and the ability to get a lot done by\nyourself.\nMarketers ship code, salespeople answer technical questions without backup, and\nproduct engineers\nwork across the stack.\nThis means there is almost always someone better at what you are doing than you are. It is tempting to get them, or anybody really, involved and \u2728 collaborate \u2728, but collaboration forces the driver to slow down and explain stuff (background, context, their thinking).\nThis tendency reveals itself in a few key phrases:\n\u201cCurious what X t\n\n[Content truncated...]"
