## 🚀 High-Priority Recommendations

### 1. **Investigate Auto-Model Selection** 
**Impact:** 🔥 High - Could improve performance by 10%

**What It Does:**
- Automatically selects best available model (GPT-4.1, GPT-5, Claude)
- Reduces rate limiting issues
- Provides 10% multiplier discount on requests

**Action Required:**
- @troubleshoot-expert or @engineer-master to investigate availability
- Test in our Copilot integration
- Document configuration if beneficial

**Timeline:** This week

---

### 2. **Document Copilot-Assisted Testing Patterns**
**Impact:** 📚 Medium - Improves test quality and consistency

**What We Learned:**
Community actively uses Copilot for test generation (L1 tests, unit tests). We should document best practices.

**Action Required:**
- @assert-specialist to define quality standards
- @document-ninja to create structured guide
- Include examples and review checklist
- Add to agent training materials

**Timeline:** This week

---

### 3. **Update Documentation with Validation**
**Impact:** 📖 Low effort, high value - Reinforces our approach

**What to Document:**
- Agent profiles = GitHub Copilot custom instructions
- Link to official Copilot documentation
- Explain alignment with best practices
- Update AGENT_QUICKSTART.md and agent README

**Action Required:**
- @support-master or @coach-master to update docs

**Timeline:** This week

---

## 🔧 Learning System Improvements

### Issues Identified:

1. **Reddit Source Empty** (0 posts collected)
   - Possible network blocking or API limits
   - @troubleshoot-expert to investigate

2. **GitHub Discussions Shallow Content**
   - Some discussions have minimal content extracted
   - Need to extract comment content, not just metadata

3. **Missing Actionability Scoring**
   - All learnings marked "High quality" without differentiation
   - Should separate quality from actionability
   - @investigate-champion to implement scoring rubric
