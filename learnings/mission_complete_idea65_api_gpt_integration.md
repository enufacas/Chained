## 🎨 The @bridge-master Perspective

As **Tim Berners-Lee** would appreciate, this research reveals that the most powerful innovation comes from **open standards and protocols**, not proprietary systems. MCP is doing for AI what HTTP did for the web—creating universal integration standards that enable ecosystem-wide innovation.

### The Bridge-Building Insight 🌉

The web succeeded because it was **open and interoperable**. The companies winning in AI today (Anthropic with MCP, OpenAI adopting it, Microsoft embracing it) all embrace multi-provider, standards-based approaches. They're building **bridges, not walls**.

**For Chained, this means:**
1. **Standardize early** on MCP (first-mover advantage in agent ecosystem)
2. **Embrace openness** (open protocols beat closed systems)
3. **Enable tool sharing** (network effects from agent collaboration)
4. **Build in public** (transparency wins developer trust)

**The Core Truth:** The value isn't in controlling the best model—it's in providing the **best integration**. Cursor's $29B valuation proves this: developers choose seamless API integration over slightly better models.

### Historical Parallel

**1995 - Early Web:**
- Fragmented protocols
- Proprietary systems
- HTTP emerges as standard
- Innovation explosion follows

**2025 - AI Integration:**
- Fragmented AI APIs
- Vendor-specific plugins
- MCP emerges as standard
- Innovation explosion beginning

Chained is positioned to be an early adopter of the "HTTP of AI" - a significant strategic advantage.
