For guidance on choosing a plan, see\nChoosing your enterprise's plan for GitHub Copilot\n.\nPremium requests\nPaid Copilot plans include premium requests. Premium requests use advanced models and features and are subject to monthly allowances or potential overage costs. See\nRequests in GitHub Copilot\n.\nSeat assignment\nA Copilot seat is a license to use GitHub Copilot for a user. Each month, your organization or enterprise is billed for the number of assigned seats.\nSeat assignment is managed by organization owners. With GitHub Enterprise Cloud, an enterprise owner must have enabled GitHub Copilot for the organization before an organization owner can assign seats. See\nGranting access to GitHub Copilot for members of your organization\n.\nIf a user receives a seat from multiple organizations in the same enterprise, the enterprise will be billed only once, and one organization is selected and billed for the seat. To determine which organization is billed for a given user, request a detailed usage report and refer to the\norganization\ncolumn for the user's Copilot license. See\nBilling reports reference\n.\nBilling cycles\nBilled users are calculated at the end of each billing cycle, based on the number of GitHub Copilot seats that are assigned. Although you can add or remove seats \n\n[Content truncated...]",

The change will take effect from the start of your next billing cycle.\nNote that GitHub may apply a temporary authorization hold for the value of the usage-based costs in advance, which will appear as a pending charge in your account's payment method.\nAbout the 30-day trial for Copilot Pro\nNote\nCopilot Pro+ does not include a trial. You will be billed immediately upon subscribing.\nBefore starting a paid plan for a personal account, you can set up a one-time 30-day trial to evaluate Copilot. To begin a trial, you will need to choose a monthly or yearly billing cycle, and provide a payment method. If you do not cancel the trial before the end of the 30 days, the trial will automatically convert to a paid plan.\nYou can cancel your Copilot trial at any time during the 30 days and you won't be charged. If you cancel before the end of the trial, you will continue to have access to Copilot until the 30-day trial period ends. See\nViewing and changing your GitHub Copilot plan\n.\nNote\nIf you were part of the free GitHub Copilot technical preview that was run between July 2021 and June 2022, you are not eligible for a 30-day trial.\nAbout premium requests\nYour Copilot plan includes premium requests.

You can change the model Copilot uses to generate responses to chat prompts. You may find that different models perform better, or provide more useful responses, depending on the type of questions you ask. Options include premium models with advanced capabilities.

Click the tabs above for other environments.\nAbout customizing Copilot responses\nGitHub Copilot can provide responses that are tailored to your personal preferences, the way your team works, the tools you use, or the specifics of your project, if you provide it with enough context to do so. Instead of repeatedly adding this contextual detail to your prompts, you can create custom instructions that automatically add this information for you. The additional information is not displayed, but is available to Copilot to allow it to generate higher quality responses.\nNote\nDue to the non-deterministic nature of AI, Copilot may not always follow your custom instructions in exactly the same way every time they are used.\nTypes of custom instructions\nThere are three main types of custom instructions that you can use to customize Copilot responses on the GitHub website:\nPersonal instructions\napply to all conversations you have with Copilot Chat across the GitHub website. They allow you to specify your individual preferences, such as preferred language or response style, ensuring that the responses are tailored to your personal needs.\nRepository custom instructions\napply to conversations within the context of a specific repository. They are useful for defining project-specific coding standards, frameworks, or tools. For example, you can specify that a repository uses TypeScript and a particular library, ensuring consistent responses for all contributors.\nOrganization custom instructions\n(public preview) apply to conversations within the context of an organization on the GitHub website. They are ideal for enforcing organization-wide preferences, such as a common language or security guidelines. Organization custom instruc\n\n[Content truncated...]",

To explore the functionality available in each environment, see the\nGitHub Copilot Chat\nhow-to guides and the\nTutorials for GitHub Copilot\n.\nLimitations\nCopilot Chat is designed to assist with coding tasks, but you remain responsible for reviewing and validating the code it generates. It may not always produce correct or optimal solutions, and it can sometimes generate code that contains security vulnerabilities or other issues. Always test and review the code before using it in production.\nCustomizing Copilot Chat responses\nGitHub Copilot in GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and Visual Studio can provide chat responses that are tailored to the way your team works, the tools you use, the specifics of your project, or your personal preferences, if you provide it with enough context to do so. Instead of repeating instructions in each prompt, you can create and save instructions for Copilot Chat to customize what responses you receive.\nThere are various ways you can create custom instructions for Copilot Chat.
