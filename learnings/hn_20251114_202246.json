      "description": "I\u2019ve been working in fairly locked\u2011down Windows environments where I\u2019m allowed to run Python, but not install or launch new `.exe` files. In addition the built-in windows dictations are blocked (the only good one isn&#x27;t local anyway). At the same time, I really wanted accurate, fast dictation without sending audio to a cloud service, and without needing a GPU. Most speech\u2011to\u2011text setups I tried either required special launchers, GPU access, or were awkward to run day\u2011to\u2011day.<p>To scratch that itch, I built Chirp, a Windows dictation app that runs fully locally, uses NVIDIA\u2019s ParakeetV3 model, and is managed end\u2011to\u2011end with `uv`. If you can run Python on your machine, you should be able to run Chirp\u2014no additional executables required.<p>Under the hood, Chirp uses the Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 ONNX bundle. ParakeetV3 has accuracy in the same ballpark as Whisper\u2011large\u2011v3 (multilingual WER ~4.9 vs ~5.0 in the open ASR leaderboard), but it\u2019s much faster and happy on CPU.<p>The flow is:\n- One\u2011time setup that downloads and prepares the ONNX model:\n  - `uv run python -m chirp.setup`\n- A long\u2011running CLI process:\n  - `uv run python -m chirp.main`\n- A global hotkey that starts&#x2F;stops recording and injects text into the active window.<p>A few details that might be interesting technically:<p>- <i>Local\u2011only STT:</i> Everything runs on your machine using ONNX Runtime; by default it uses CPU providers, with optional GPU providers if your environment allows.<p>- <i>Config\u2011driven behavior:</i> A `config.toml` file controls the global hotkey, model choice, quantization (`int8` option), language, ONNX providers, and threading. There\u2019s also a simple `[word_overrides]` map so you can fix tokens that the model consistently mishears.<p>- <i>Post\u2011processing pipeline:</i> After recognition, there\u2019s an optional \u201cstyle guide\u201d step where you can specify prompts like \u201csentence case\u201d or \u201cprepend: &gt;&gt;\u201d for the final text.<p>- <i>No clipboard gymnastics required on Windows:</i> The app types directly into the focused window; there are options for clipboard\u2011based pasting and cleanup behavior for platforms where that makes more sense.<p>- <i>Audio feedback:</i> Start&#x2F;stop sounds (configurable) let you know when the mic is actually recording.<p>So far I\u2019ve mainly tested this on my own Windows machines with English dictation and CPU\u2011only setups. There are probably plenty of rough edges (different keyboard layouts, language settings, corporate IT policies, etc.), and I\u2019d love feedback from people who:<p>- Work in restricted corporate environments and need local dictation.\n- Have experience with Parakeet&#x2F;Whisper or ONNX Runtime and see obvious ways to improve performance or robustness.\n- Want specific features (e.g., better multi\u2011language support, more advanced post\u2011processing, or integrations with their editor&#x2F;IDE).<p>Repo is here:  \n`<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Whamp&#x2F;chirp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Whamp&#x2F;chirp</a>`<p>If you try it, I\u2019d be very interested in:<p>- CPU usage and latency on your hardware,\n- How well it behaves with your keyboard layout and applications,\n- Any weird failure cases or usability annoyances you run into.<p>Happy to answer questions and dig into technical details in the comments.",
