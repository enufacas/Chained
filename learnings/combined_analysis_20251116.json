Some teammates jot down their schedule deviations, while others detail what they intend to focus on for the week. Nathan just wrapped up top-of-mind announcements and Morgan is sharing trends from our metrics and covering operational updates. Meanwhile I'm preparing user quotes from the last week to share out, and others add topics to the Discussions section. Throughout the meeting, screens are being shared, various voices are popping in and out of the conversation, and our notes are growing rapidly as dozens of cursors are concurrently editing the same file in real-time. This entire meeting is taking place inside Zed. Our weekly \"all hands\" Monday meeting in Zed Our mission from the beginning has been to engineer an editor that will be: Responsive : The latency between keystroke and re-render should be imperceptible. Focused : The interface should offer minimal distractions and stay out of the code's way. Collaborative : Working with teammates should feel no different than sitting next to them in the office. Setting the first two properties aside, let's focus on collaboration. Collaboration Built into Zed's DNA We've been dreaming of building the ultimate collaborative editor for years. The roots of this vision go back to Nathan's early days at Pivotal Labs , where pair programming with two keyboards plugged into the same computer was the standard practice. We set out to recreate that seamless collaboration experience\u2014but for distributed teams. But wait... doesn't this technology already exist in other editors? Yes! If you've been a developer long enough, you might recall the teletype package for Atom \u2014both built by Zed's founders. Teletype enabled developers to share \"portals\" into their workspaces, which was an initial step towards Zed's collaborative vision.

Our live payment processing platform was not impacted. No merchant funds or card numbers were accessed. We are donating the ransom amount to fund cybercrime research. Last week, Checkout.com was contacted by a criminal group known as \u201cShinyHunters\u201d, who claimed to have obtained data connected to Checkout.com and demanded a ransom. Upon investigation, we determined that this data was obtained by gaining unauthorized access to a legacy third-party cloud file storage system, used in 2020 and prior years. We estimate that this would affect less than 25% of our current merchant base. The system was used for internal operational documents and merchant onboarding materials at that time. This incident has not impacted our payment processing platform. The threat actors do not have, and never had, access to merchant funds or card numbers. The episode occurred when threat actors gained access to this third party legacy system which was not decommissioned properly. This was our mistake, and we take full responsibility. We are sorry.

Blender has been there for your projects, your learning, your art, your business. Today, we're asking for $5. That's it. If every active Blender user contributed $5 this month, Blender Foundation would meet its entire yearly funding goal for 2026. I already donated Remind me later Introducing an innovation space within the Blender project, where designers and developers can work together on challenging or future-facing projects, to keep Blender relevant in the years to come. Over the years, Blender has grown and matured into a powerful and complex piece of software. With its unstoppable release cycle, a massive, highly demanding, and diverse user community, natural technical debt, and complex technical dependencies, shipping new features and general improvements requires more and more effort and coordination. Software stability and reliability have become critical for individuals and companies. As a consequence, development efforts focus on those aspects, offering progressive improvements of existing functionality only when these are clear enhancements of what is already there. This makes it more challenging to innovate, think outside the box, experiment, and break things. To facilitate this essential aspect of product development, the Blender Foundation is establishing a new project: the Blender Lab. This is the innovation space where designers, developers, and researchers work together on challenging and future-facing projects that will help Blender stay relevant in the years to come.

For the Prosopo team, MongoDB Atlas was initially a fast, reliable way to run a cloud database, but as our data grew, so did the bills. Over the last year, we realised that we were spending thousands of dollars per month on infrastructure that we could run more efficiently ourselves. We explored various options but ultimately decided to migrate our MongoDB deployment to Hetzner, a cost-effective cloud provider. Here's how we managed to cut our costs by 90% without sacrificing performance or reliability. Starting with MongoDB Atlas for Free but Scaling Costs Added Up When we first started building, MongoDB Atlas was an easy choice. Everything was set up for us, and we could focus on building our application without worrying about database management. The free tier was sufficient for our initial needs, and as we grew, scaling up was as simple as a few clicks. However, scaling came with a steep price tag. We went from paying $0 per month for a small database to over $3,000 per month for a few hundred GBs of data. The cost breakdown before we migrated looked roughly like this: Service Monthly Cost Atlas M40 Instance - AWS $1000 Atlas Continuous Cloud Backup Storage $700 Atlas AWS Data Transfer (Same Region) $10 Atlas AWS Data Transfer (Different Region) $1 Atlas AWS Data Transfer (Internet) $1,000 \u2757 Total + VAT $3000+ The more keen eyed among you will have noticed the huge cost associated with data transfer over the internet - its as much as the servers! We're building Prosopo to be resilient to outages, such as the recent massive AWS outage , so we use many different cloud providers.

I got curious how easy it'd be to hack my Yaesu FT-70D, so I started doing some research. The only existing resource I could find for Yaesu radios was someone who posted about custom firmware for their Yaesu FT1DR . The Reddit poster mentioned that if you go through the firmware update process via USB, the radio exposes its Renesas H8SX microcontroller and can have its flash modified using the Renesas SDK. This was a great start and looked promising, but the SDK wasn't trivial to configure and I wasn't sure if it could even dump the firmware... so I didn't use it for very long. # Other Avenues Yaesu provides a Windows application on their website that can be used to update a radio's firmware over USB: The zip contains the following files: 1.2 MB Wed Nov 8 14:34:38 2017 FT-70D_ver111(USA).exe 682 KB Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 2017 FT-70DR_DE_Firmware_Update_Information_ENG_1711-B.pdf 8 MB Mon Apr 23 00:00:00 2018 FT-70DR_DE_MAIN_Firmware_Ver_Up_Manual_ENG_1804-B.pdf 3.2 MB Fri Jan 6 17:54:44 2012 HMSEUSBDRIVER.exe 160 KB Sat Sep 17 15:14:16 2011 RComms.dll 61 KB Tue Oct 23 17:02:08 2012 RFP_USB_VB.dll 1.7 MB Fri Mar 29 11:54:02 2013 vcredist_x86.exe I'm going to assume that the file specific to the FT-70D, \"FT-70D_ver111(USA).exe\", will likely contain our firmware image.

Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature --no-quarantine is used to forcibly bypass Gatekeeper, which is a built-in macOS security mechanism. This is used to run unsigned/unnotarized applications. macOS Tahoe is the final release to support Intel systems, and last year Apple updated macOS runtime protection to make it harder to override Gatekeeper. Macs with Apple silicon also don't \" permit native arm64 code to execute unless a valid signature is attached \". Finally, we are ending support for all casks that fail Gatekeeper checks on September 1st, 2026. With the above in mind, it's time to deprecate the --no-quarantine flag from brew . It intentionally bypasses macOS security mechanisms, which we already actively discourage. Deprecating now will give a decent lead time for users using it to come up with another solution or adjust their workflows. What is the motivation for the feature? Intel support is coming to an end from both Apple and Homebrew. This flag is primarily used to override a macOS security mechanism, which we do not want to encourage. Since we are requiring casks fulfill Gatekeeper checks next year, there is no reason to keep this flag. How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?

Information Author Gareth Dennis , A commuter train waits to leave the station somewhere in London, 18 May 2023. Photo: IMAGO / Pond5 Images Liberalization of the railways has been a key tenet of European transport policy since the early 2000s, with proponents claiming that competition results in improved service quality and increased ridership. This is an instantly disprovable statement given that ridership was already on the rise across Europe prior to, rather than after, liberalization efforts, suggesting other effects are at play. Gareth Dennis is an award-winning railway engineer and writer. He is the author of the internationally bestselling book How The Railways Will Fix the Future and co-founder of the Campaign for Level Boarding. On the other hand, the case against fragmented and privatized operations focuses on three key arguments. The first is that railways are complex systems where commercial boundaries at engineering interfaces are a threat to safety and efficiency. The second is that railway operations are geographic monopolies where market conditions are \u2014 at best \u2014 contrived. The third is that railways are a public service that cannot fail \u2014 hence, introducing private interests into the railways is merely a way to sequester income into private hands while the state shoulders the financial risk. In other words, private interests\u2019 role is simply to extract profit that could otherwise be reinvested into the system. The United Kingdom was one of first countries in Europe to liberalize a significant portion of its railways (Northern Ireland\u2019s railways remained publicly owned and operated). As such, the aftermath of privatization is instructive in tracing liberalization\u2019s final destination. In short\n\n[Content truncated...]",

The tl;dr is that it\u2019s a delightful laptop, and Linux runs flawlessly, and all the hardware things I\u2019ve needed run OOTB. The only difficulty I had was in disabling Secure Boot, but I figured out how to do it, which I explain below. Contents Background Troubleshooting Secure Boot Spyware Non-Problems BIOS Notes Links Background From early 2024 my daily driver was an M2 MacBook Air, until earlier this year I broke the screen, and the repair was quoted at almost 1000 AUD. Since I used it as a desktop most of the time, this didn\u2019t affect me much. After some flip-flopping I decided to get an M4 Mac mini. Partly for the faster CPU and more RAM, but partly because I liked the idea of LARPing like it\u2019s the 2000s, when computers, and by extension the Internet, where fixed in physical space, rather than following everyone around. Of course this was a terrible idea. I had three working computers\u2014a Linux+Windows desktop, a Mac Mini, and a MacBook Air that I could use as a desktop\u2014and none of them were portable. When I went to RustForge 2025 I just brought my phone. If I wanted to travel, even within Sydney, to a demo night or math club or some such, I didn\u2019t have a laptop to bring with me. So I needed a new laptop. And the Tahoe release of macOS was so ugly (see e.g. 1 , 2 , 3 ) it made me boot up the old Linux desktop, and start playing around with NixOS again. And I fell in love with Linux again: with the tinkering and the experimentation and the freedom it affords you. So, I wanted a Linux laptop. I had a ThinkPad X1 some years ago and it was terribly: flimsy plastic build and hardware that vastly underperformed its price. I looked around for old, refursbished workstation laptops, and, randomly, I ran into an eBay seller offering a refurbished Fujitsu laptop. The specs/price ratio was pretty good: 16 GiB of RAM and 512GiB of SSD, all for 250 AUD. And it was 12in and 1.1kg, which I like: laptops shou\n\n[Content truncated...]",

      "content": "Messing with bots 13 Nov, 2025 As outlined in my previous two posts : scrapers are, inadvertently, DDoSing public websites. I've received a number of emails from people running small web services and blogs seeking advice on how to protect themselves. This post isn't about that. This post is about fighting back. When I published my last post, there was an interesting write-up doing the rounds about a guy who set up a Markov chain babbler to feed the scrapers endless streams of generated data. The idea here is that these crawlers are voracious, and if given a constant supply of junk data, they will continue consuming it forever, while (hopefully) not abusing your actual web server. This is a pretty neat idea, so I dove down the rabbit hole and learnt about Markov chains, and even picked up Rust in the process. I ended up building my own babbler that could be trained on any text data, and would generate realistic looking content based on that data. Now, the AI scrapers are actually not the worst of the bots. The real enemy, at least to me, are the bots that scrape with malicious intent. I get hundreds of thousands of requests for things like .env , .aws , and all the different .php paths that could potentially signal a misconfigured Wordpress instance. These people are the real baddies. Generally I just block these requests with a 403 response. But since they want .php files, why don't I give them what they want? I trained my Markov chain on a few hundred .php files, and set it to generate. The responses certainly look like php at a glance, but on closer inspection they're obviously fake. I set it up to run on an isolated project of mine, while incrementally increasing the size of the generated php files from 2kb to 10mb just to test the waters. Here's a sample 1kb output: ' . $errmsg_generic .

Designing a Language Of course you want to design (and implement!) your own programming language! It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s creative. It\u2019s empowering. How do we do it? In a nutshell, the process is iterative, cycling between four phases: Doing the phases over and over is important; for example, while writing the compiler, you may be like \u201cwoah this is impossible\u201d and then realize \u201coh shoot this part of the language wasn\u2019t designed right!\u201d Prerequisites It helps to be experienced. If you\u2019re not, that\u2019s okay, actually\u2014you might get lucky! But don\u2019t mistake creativity for luck that shows up without pre-existing knowledge. The most creative people are those with a lot of knowledge and experience. So you should still study and practice! Your success as a language designer will be massively aided by knowledge in three main areas: Programming Paradigms . You should know a number of different ways that computations can be structured. These include: imperative declarative structured object-oriented functional applicative concatenative logic protocol-oriented aspect-oriented array event-driven dataflow agent-based etc. See Wikipedia\u2019s list of programming paradigms . Programming Language Concepts . You should have a good sense of most, if not all, of the following things: Sequencing, conditional execution, iteration, recursion, functional decomposition, modularity, synchronization, metaprogramming, binding, scope, extent, volatility, subtyping, pattern matching, type inference, closures, prototypes, introspection, instrumentation, annotations, decorators, memoization, traits, streams, monads, actors, mailboxes, comprehensions, continuations, wildcards, promises, regular expressions, proxies, transactional memory, inheritance, polymorphism, parameter modes,\n\n[Content truncated...]",

It's unfortunately no longer enough to force websites to check your government-issued ID before you can access certain content, because politicians have now discovered that people are using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to protect their privacy and bypass these invasive laws. Their solution? Entirely ban the use of VPNs. Yes, really. As of this writing, Wisconsin lawmakers are escalating their war on privacy by targeting VPNs in the name of \u201cprotecting children\u201d in A.B. 105 / S.B. 130 . It\u2019s an age verification bill that requires all websites distributing material that could conceivably be deemed \u201csexual content\u201d to both implement an age verification system and also to block the access of users connected via VPN. The bill seeks to broadly expand the definition of materials that are \u201charmful to minors\u201d beyond the type of speech that states can prohibit minors from accessing\u2014potentially encompassing things like depictions and discussions of human anatomy, sexuality, and reproduction. This follows a notable pattern: As we\u2019ve explained previously , lawmakers, prosecutors, and activists in conservative states have worked for years to aggressively expand the definition of \u201charmful to minors\u201d to censor a broad swath of content: diverse educational materials , sex education resources , art, and even award-winning literature . Wisconsin\u2019s bill has already passed the State Assembly and is now moving through the Senate. If it becomes law, Wisconsin could become the first state where using a VPN to access certain content is banned. Michigan lawmakers have proposed similar legislation that did not move through its legislature, but among other things, would force internet providers to actively monitor and block VPN connections. And in the UK, officials are calling VPNs \"a loophole that needs closing.\" This is actually happenin\n\n[Content truncated...]",

      "content": "The Go Blog Go\u2019s Sweet 16 Austin Clements, for the Go team 14 November 2025 This past Monday, November 10th, we celebrated the 16th anniversary of Go\u2019s open source release ! We released Go 1.24 in February and Go 1.25 in August , following our now well-established and dependable release cadence. Continuing our mission to build the most productive language platform for building production systems, these releases included new APIs for building robust and reliable software, significant advances in Go\u2019s track record for building secure software, and some serious under-the-hood improvements. Meanwhile, no one can ignore the seismic shifts in our industry brought by generative AI. The Go team is applying its thoughtful and uncompromising mindset to the problems and opportunities of this dynamic space, working to bring Go\u2019s production-ready approach to building robust AI integrations, products, agents, and infrastructure. Core language and library improvements First released in Go 1.24 as an experiment and then graduated in Go 1.25, the new testing/synctest package significantly simplifies writing tests for concurrent, asynchronous code . Such code is particularly common in network services, and is traditionally very hard to test well. The synctest package works by virtualizing time itself. It takes tests that used to be slow, flaky, or both, and makes them easy to rewrite into reliable and nearly instantaneous tests, often with just a couple extra lines of code. It\u2019s also a great example of Go\u2019s integrated approach to software development: behind an almost trivial API, the synctest package hides a deep integration with the Go runtime and other parts of the standard library. This isn\u2019t the only boost the testing package got over the past year. The new testing.B.Loop API is both easier to use than the original testing.B.N API and addresses many of the traditional\u2014and often invisible!\u2014 pitfalls of writing Go benchmarks. The testing package also has new APIs that make it easy\n\n[Content truncated...]",

We think that opening up AI\u2019s compute landscape is one of the most important problems to be working on right now. Building towards this goal, we present HipKittens: SoTA AMD kernels and a collection of opinionated programming primitives to make AMD kernel dev easier! Named after AMD's CUDA equivalent, called HIP . Building towards multi-silicon AI systems While AI has largely used a single hardware vendor to get to its current stage, AMD GPU hardware now offers state-of-the-art peak compute and memory bandwidth.

The AMD software ecosystem includes AITER , a high performance AI kernel library; PyTorch and a few compilers ( Triton , Mojo , TileLang ); and Composable Kernel (CK) , AMD's C++ based programming model for writing kernels. However, despite gigawatt-scale AMD deployments , the software remains brittle. The existing software offerings fail to consistently achieve peak performance. CK kernels frequently underperform (see our evaluations below). AITER and PyTorch are volatile; for instance, AITER and PyTorch SDPA Llama GQA backwards kernels achieve just 30% and 24% of SoTA performance respectively on AMD MI355X GPUs.

      "description": "Hey HN! We\u2019re Jason &amp; Matt and we\u2019re building Tweeks (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tweeks.io\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tweeks.io</a>), a browser extension that lets you modify any website in your browser to add functionality, filter&#x2F;highlight, re-theme, reorganize, de-clutter, etc. If you\u2019ve used Violentmonkey&#x2F;Tampermonkey, Tweeks is like a next\u2011generation userscript manager. Instead of digging through selectors and hand\u2011writing custom JS&#x2F;CSS, describe what you want in natural language and Tweeks plans + generates your edits and applies them.<p>The modern web is so full of clutter and junk (banners, modals, feeds, and recommendations you didn\u2019t ask for). Even a simple google search is guarded by multiple ads, an AI overview, a trending searches module, etc. before you even see the first real blue link.<p>Every day there&#x27;s a new Lovable-like product (make it simple to build your own website&#x2F;app) or a new agentic browser (AI agents click around and browse the web for you), but we built Tweeks to serve the middle ground: most of our time spent on the web is on someone else&#x27;s site (not our own), and we don&#x27;t want to offload everything to an agentic browser. We want to be able to shape the entire web to our own preferences as we browse.<p>I spent years working on recommendation systems and relevance at Pinterest, and understand how well-meaning recommendations and A&#x2F;B tests can lead to website enshittification. No one sets out to make UX worse, but optimizing for an \u201caverage\u201d user is not the same as optimizing for each individual user.<p>I\u2019ve also been hacking \u201cpage fixers\u201d as long as I can remember: remove a login wall here, collapse cookie banners there, add missing filters&#x2F;highlights (first with F12&#x2F;inspect element and eventually graduated to advanced GreaseMonkey userscripts). Tweeks started as a weekend prototype that turned simple requests into page edits but unexpectedly grew into something people kept asking to share. We hope you\u2019ll like it too!<p>How it works: Open the Tweeks extension, type your request (e.g. \u201chide cookie banners and add a price&#x2F;quality score\u201d), and submit. Upon submission, the page structure is captured, an AI agent reviews the structure, plans changes, and returns deterministic transformations (selectors, layout tweaks, styles, and small scripts) that run locally. Your modifications persist across page loads and can be enabled&#x2F;disabled, modified, and shared.<p>Here are a bunch of one\u2011shot examples from early users:<p><i>Youtube</i>: Remove Youtube Shorts.

      "description": "Hi HN - I\u2019m Peter, here with Harry (devhawk), and we\u2019re building DBOS Java, an open-source Java library for durable workflows, backed by Postgres.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dbos-inc&#x2F;dbos-transact-java\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dbos-inc&#x2F;dbos-transact-java</a><p>Essentially, DBOS helps you write long-lived, reliable code that can survive failures, restarts, and crashes without losing state or duplicating work. As your workflows run, it checkpoints each step they take in a Postgres database. When a process stops (fails, restarts, or crashes), your program can recover from those checkpoints to restore its exact state and continue from where it left off, as if nothing happened.<p>In practice, this makes it easier to build reliable systems for use cases like AI agents, payments, data synchronization, or anything that takes hours, days, or weeks to complete. Rather than bolting on ad-hoc retry logic and database checkpoints, durable workflows give you one consistent model for ensuring your programs can recover from any failure from exactly where they left off.<p>This library contains all you need to add durable workflows to your program: there&#x27;s no separate service or orchestrator or any external dependencies except Postgres. Because it&#x27;s just a library, you can incrementally add it to your projects, and it works out of the box with frameworks like Spring. And because it&#x27;s built on Postgres, it natively supports all the tooling you&#x27;re familiar with (backups, GUIs, CLI tools) and works with any Postgres provider.<p>If you want to try it out, check out the quickstart:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.dbos.dev&#x2F;quickstart?language=java\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.dbos.dev&#x2F;quickstart?language=java</a><p>We&#x27;d love to hear what you think! We\u2019ll be in the comments for the rest of the day to answer any questions.",

We know that security works best when it accounts for the diverse ways people use our tools. This is why we announced this change early: to gather input and ensure our solutions are balanced. We appreciate the community's engagement and have heard the early feedback \u2013 specifically from students and hobbyists who need an accessible path to learn, and from power users who are more comfortable with security risks. We are making changes to address the needs of both groups. To understand how these updates fit into our broader mission, it is important to first look at the specific threats we are tackling. Why verification is important Keeping users safe on Android is our top priority. Combating scams and digital fraud is not new for us \u2014 it has been a central focus of our work for years. From Scam Detection in Google Messages to Google Play Protect and real-time alerts for scam calls, we have consistently acted to keep our ecosystem safe . However, online scams and malware campaigns are becoming more aggressive. At the global scale of Android, this translates to real harm for people around the world \u2013 especially in rapidly digitizing regions where many are coming online for the first time. Technical safeguards are critical, but they cannot solve for every scenario where a user i\n\n[Content truncated...]",

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems. The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context. Who are the problems aimed at? The intended audience include students for whom the basic curriculum is not feeding their hunger to learn, adults whose background was not primarily mathematics but had an interest in things mathematical, and professionals who want to keep their problem solving and mathematics on the cutting edge. Currently we have 1365127 registered members who have solved at least one problem, representing 220 locations throughout the world, and collectively using 113 different programming languages to solve the problems. Can anyone solve the problems? The problems range in difficulty and for many the experience is inductive chain learning. That is, by solving one problem it will expose you to a new concept that may allow you to undertake a previously inaccessible problem. So determined participants will be able to slowly but surely work their way through the problems. What next?

      "content": "November 12, 2025 Marble, our frontier multimodal world model, is available to everyone starting today Marble: A Multimodal World Model Spatial intelligence is the next frontier in AI, demanding powerful world models to realize its full potential. World models should reconstruct, generate, and simulate 3D worlds; and allow both humans and agents to interact with them. Spatially intelligent world models will transform a wide variety of industries over the coming years. Two months ago we shared a preview of Marble , our World Model that creates 3D worlds from image or text prompts. Since then, Marble has been available to an early set of beta users to create 3D worlds for themselves. Today we are making Marble, a first-in-class generative multimodal world model, generally available for anyone to use. We have also drastically expanded Marble's capabilities, and are excited to highlight them here: Multimodal Marble : Marble is now massively multimodal. Marble can create 3D worlds from text, images, video, or coarse 3D layouts; Marble also lets you interactively edit, expand, and combine worlds. Once generated, 3D worlds can be exported as Gaussian splats, meshes, or videos.

This means WhatsApp on Windows 11 is cooked, and it\u2019s back to being absolute garbage in terms of performance. WhatsApp is one of those Windows apps that went from being a web wrapper to a native app and then back to the web again after all these years of investment. WhatsApp for Windows was originally an Electron app, and it was eventually replaced with UWP after years of investment. Four years later, WhatsApp is going back to WebView2, abandoning the original WinUI/UWP native idea. I blame the layoffs My understanding is that the recent layoffs at Mark Zuckerberg-headed Meta likely disbanded the entire team behind the native WhatsApp. I don\u2019t see any other reason why Meta would abandon its native app for Windows. Meta will save costs by maintaining the web app codebase on Windows, but you\u2019re going to hate the experience. How bad is the new WhatsApp for Windows 11? Our tests showed that new Chromium/WebView2-based WhatsApp for Windows 11 uses up to 300MB of RAM when you are on the login screen and doing nothing. On the other hand, the old/native WhatsApp uses just 18MB of RAM and even slips to less than 10MB when left idle on the login screen. After logging in, WhatsApp (new) memory usage increased to 2GB while trying to load all my chats. On average, it used 1.2GB when left idle in the background . You\u2019d realise how bad this is when I tell you the benchmarks for the native WhatsApp for comparison. I tested the old/native WhatsApp, and it uses just 190MB most of the time, dropping to less than 100MB when it\u2019s completely idle. At worst, it would reach 300MB, which can happen only when the chat is really active. \u201cWhatsApp\u201d is new version and \u201cWhatsApp Be\n\n[Content truncated...]",

The online version has been available since 2001, and now there is also a throughly revised version available in book form . We wanted to do two things with this course. First, we wanted to provide a text that was relatively self contained, a text that would permit someone with little or no knowledge of computing to pick up the basics of Prolog with the minimum of fuss. We also wanted the text to be clear enough to make it useful for self study. We believe that if you read the text, and do the associated exercises, you will gain a useful partial entry to the world of Prolog. But only a partial entry, and this brings us to our second point. We want to emphasize the practical aspects of Prolog. Prolog is something you do. You can't learn a programming language simply by reading about it, and if you really want to get the most out of this course, we strongly advise you to get hold of a Prolog interpreter (you'll find pointers to some nice ones on this website) and work through all the Practical Sessions that we provide. And of course, don't stop with what we provide. The more you program, the better you'll get.... We hope you enjoy the course.

In an analysis of more than 6,800 colon cancer patients across all University of California Health sites, researchers found that those taking glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) medications were less than half as likely to die within five years compared to those who weren\u2019t on the drugs (15.5% vs. 37.1%). The study, led by Raphael Cuomo , Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and member of UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, used real-world clinical data from the University of California Health Data Warehouse to assess outcomes across the state\u2019s academic medical centers. After adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), disease severity and other health factors, GLP-1 users still showed significantly lower odds of death, suggesting a strong and independent protective effect. The survival benefit appeared most pronounced in patients with very high BMI (over 35), hinting that GLP-1 drugs may help counteract the inflammatory and metabolic conditions that worsen colon cancer prognosis. Researchers believe several biological mechanisms could explain the link. Beyond regulating blood sugar, GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce systemic inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss \u2014 all factors that can dampen tumor-promot\n\n[Content truncated...]",

Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature --no-quarantine is used to forcibly bypass Gatekeeper, which is a built-in macOS security mechanism. This is used to run unsigned/unnotarized applications. macOS Tahoe is the final release to support Intel systems, and last year Apple updated macOS runtime protection to make it harder to override Gatekeeper. Macs with Apple silicon also don't \" permit native arm64 code to execute unless a valid signature is attached \". Finally, we are ending support for all casks that fail Gatekeeper checks on September 1st, 2026. With the above in mind, it's time to deprecate the --no-quarantine flag from brew . It intentionally bypasses macOS security mechanisms, which we already actively discourage. Deprecating now will give a decent lead time for users using it to come up with another solution or adjust their workflows. What is the motivation for the feature? Intel support is coming to an end from both Apple and Homebrew. This flag is primarily used to override a macOS security mechanism, which we do not want to encourage. Since we are requiring casks fulfill Gatekeeper checks next year, there is no reason to keep this flag. How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users? We will provide a safer experience for our users, and stop making it easier to bypass OS-level security. What alt\n\n[Content truncated...]",

Please sign in or subscribe to access the full content. Space, as they say, is pretty big, and human-made objects are slow. The record speed any human has ever traveled was set by Apollo 10 back in 1969, and has not been broken since. The fastest human spaceflight remains 39,937.7 kilometers per hour (24,816.1 miles per hour), and at those speeds, it would take 3,730 hours to travel just 1 astronomical unit (AU), the distance between the Earth and the Sun. At around 155 days, that's an unacceptable travel time to (for example) slam into the Sun. And while it takes you 155 days to get wherever it is you went, light and communications from Earth would reach you in about 8 minutes and 20 seconds, really rubbing it in how great it is to be massless. But we will get a real reminder of the vast distance and incredible speed of light in late 2026, when Voyager 1 becomes the first human-made object to reach one light-day away from Earth. This spacecraft was launched in 1977 and has been traveling ever since. At the time of writing, it is around 169.5 AU from the Earth, having become the first spacecraft to go beyond the heliosphere, cross the heliopause , and enter interstellar space. At its current position, it takes 23 hours, 29 minutes, and 27 seconds for signals from Earth to reach the spacecraft. At its current speed of about 61,198 kilometers per hour (38,027 miles per hour), it will still take over a year to widen that light-distance to a full 24 hours. When it does reach 25.9 billion kilometers ( 16 billion miles ) from Earth, a journey that took nearly 50 years, it will finally be the distance that light can travel in a day. According to calculations from IFLScience's resident astronomer, Dr Alfredo Carpineti , using data from NASA's Eyes on the Solar System , this will occur on November 13, 2026. \n\n[Content truncated...]",

Nevermind the freshly baked pound cakes under Tupperware domes like trophies, which she kept atop the washing machine, also in the kitchen, or the biscuits she could whip up with nary a measuring device or recipe.

My mother tried to explain that it was a commodity provided by government funding for the school cafeteria where my grandmother worked. \u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t mention the cheese,\u201d Mom said recently, when I told her about writing this story.

The backlog of events we needed to process from that outage on the 20th stretched our system to the limits, and so we decided to increase our headroom for event handling throughput. When we attempted that infrastructure upgrade on October 23rd, we ran into yet another race condition bug in Aurora RDS. This is the story of how we figured out it was an AWS bug (later confirmed by AWS) and what we learned. Background The Hightouch Events product enables organizations to gather and centralize user behavioral data such as page views, clicks, and purchases. Customers can setup syncs to load events into a cloud data warehouse for analytics or stream them directly to marketing, operational, and analytics tools to support real-time personalization use cases. Here is the portion of Hightouch\u2019s architecture dedicated to our events system: Hightouch events system architecture Our system scales on three levers: Kubernetes clusters that contain event collectors and batch workers, Kafka for event processing, and Postgres as our virtual queue metadata store. When our pagers went off during the AWS outage on the 20th, we observed: Services were unable to connect to Kafka brokers managed by AWS MSK. Services struggled to autoscale because we couldn\u2019t provision new EC2 nodes. Customer functions for realtime data transformation were unavailable due to AWS STS errors, which caused our retry queues to balloon in size. Kafka\u2019s durability meant that no events were dropped once they were accepted by the collectors, but there was a massive backlog to process. Syncs with consistently high traffic or with enrichments that needed to call slower 3rd party services took longer to catch up and were testing the limits of our (small) Postgres instance\u2019s ability to act as a queue for the batch metadata.

They develop, run websites and operate web services for multiple clients. Everyone had multiple responsibilities, and they heavily relied on interns and freshmen\u2014which can be both bad and good. For me it was good because I learned a lot. At some point we needed a monitoring solution, and Zabbix didn\u2019t fit well into the new and declarative world of containers and Docker. I was tasked to find a solution. I looked at Loki/Prometheus with Grafana and Elastic with Kibana. Elastic was a beast! Heavy, hard to run, resource-hungry, and complex, Loki and Prometheus were the perfect fit back then. So I created a docker-compose.yaml with Loki, Prometheus and Grafana. Since they all had the internal Docker network, we required no auth between them. Grafana was only exposed over an SSH tunnel. One static scrape config and the Docker Loki log plugin later, we had our observability stack. For non-Docker logs, we used Promtail. Loki and Prometheus stayed on the same machine and all we required was a local volume mount. Load was minimal. \u2139\ufe0f This is when I learned that you should not transform every log parameter to an label just to make it easier to select in the Grafana UI. Having a label for latency with basically limitless values will fill every disks inodes, thats just how Cortex bin-packs. I also found out Grafana Labs has a cloud offering with a nice free tier. So I even used this for personal stuff. I had a good experience with them. Time goes on, and I switched jobs. Now we have Kubernetes. The Prometheus container was now switching nodes.

It's unfortunately no longer enough to force websites to check your government-issued ID before you can access certain content, because politicians have now discovered that people are using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to protect their privacy and bypass these invasive laws. Their solution? Entirely ban the use of VPNs. Yes, really. As of this writing, Wisconsin lawmakers are escalating their war on privacy by targeting VPNs in the name of \u201cprotecting children\u201d in A.B. 105 / S.B. 130 . It\u2019s an age verification bill that requires all websites distributing material that could conceivably be deemed \u201csexual content\u201d to both implement an age verification system and also to block the access of users connected via VPN. The bill seeks to broadly expand the definition of materials that are \u201charmful to minors\u201d beyond the type of speech that states can prohibit minors from accessing\u2014potentially encompassing things like depictions and discussions of human anatomy, sexuality, and reproduction. This follows a notable pattern: As we\u2019ve explained previously , lawmakers, prosecutors, and activists in conservative states have worked for years to aggressively expand the definition of \u201charmful to minors\u201d to censor a broad swath of content: diverse educational materials , sex education resources , art, and even award-winning literature . Wisconsin\u2019s bill has already passed the State Assembly and is now moving through the Senate. If it becomes law, Wisconsin could become the first state where using a VPN to access certain content is banned. Michigan lawmakers have proposed similar legislation that did not move through its legislature, but among other things, would force internet providers to actively monitor and block VPN connections.

In this article I want to show you some interesting technical facts I learned about AWK. Lack of GC AWK was designed to not require a GC (garbage collector) for its implementation. By the way, just like sh/bash. (I learned this remarkable fact from the oilshell blog \u2013 rather interesting technical blog, where author describes his progress in creating the \u201cbetter bash\u201d). The most substantial consequence is that it\u2019s forbidden to return an array from a function, you can return only a scalar value. function f () { a [ 1 ] = 2 return a # error } However, you can pass an array to a function and fill it there BEGIN { fill ( arr ) print arr [ 0 ] \" \" arr [ 1 ] } function fill ( arr , i ) { arr [ i ++ ] = \"hello\" ; arr [ i ++ ] = \"world\" } The thing is, in a lack of GC all heap allocations must be deterministic. That is, array, declared locally in a function must be destroyed at the moment when function returns. That\u2019s why it\u2019s disallowed to escape the declaration scope of a function (via return). The absense of GC allows to keep the language implementation very simple, thus fast and portable. Also, with predictable memory consumption. To me, this qualifies AWK as perfect embeddable language, although, for some reason this niche is firmly occupied by (GC-equipped) Lua. Local variables All variables are global by default. However, if you add a variable to the function parameters (like i above) it becomes local. JavaScript works in a similar way, although there are more suitable var / let / const keywords. In practice, it is customary to separate \u201creal\u201d function parameters from \u201clocal\u201d parameters with additional spaces for clarity. Although Brian Kernighan (the K in AWK) regrets this design, in practice it works just fine. The notation for function locals is appalling (all my faul\n\n[Content truncated...]",

Everyone has experienced being broke. Being broke sucks. You are watching every dollar spent, finding ways to trim or make things stretch until the next payday. The difference is when you are broke you have some money . You can afford to put gas in your car, but not enough to do that repair. Money is tight, but you can get the basics at the grocery store. You can\u2019t afford to go to the movies, but will stay home and watch what\u2019s new on Netflix. When you are poor that next payday brings no relief. It is like an endless runner game. No matter how fast you run or how high you jump you can never see the finish line. No matter how tired you are the ground keeps moving.

      "content": "The Go Blog Go\u2019s Sweet 16 Austin Clements, for the Go team 14 November 2025 This past Monday, November 10th, we celebrated the 16th anniversary of Go\u2019s open source release ! We released Go 1.24 in February and Go 1.25 in August , following our now well-established and dependable release cadence. Continuing our mission to build the most productive language platform for building production systems, these releases included new APIs for building robust and reliable software, significant advances in Go\u2019s track record for building secure software, and some serious under-the-hood improvements. Meanwhile, no one can ignore the seismic shifts in our industry brought by generative AI. The Go team is applying its thoughtful and uncompromising mindset to the problems and opportunities of this dynamic space, working to bring Go\u2019s production-ready approach to building robust AI integrations, products, agents, and infrastructure. Core language and library improvements First released in Go 1.24 as an experiment and then graduated in Go 1.25, the new testing/synctest package significantly simplifies writing tests for concurrent, asynchronous code . Such code is particularly common in network services, and is traditionally very hard to test well. The synctest package works by virtualizing time itself. It takes tests that used to be slow, flaky, or both, and makes them easy to rewrite into reliable and nearly instantaneous tests, often with just a couple extra lines of code. It\u2019s also a great example of Go\u2019s integrated approach to software development: behind an almost trivial API, the synctest package hides a deep integration with the Go runtime and other parts of the standard library. This isn\u2019t the only boost the testing package got over the past year. The new testing.B.Loop API is both easier to use than the original testing.B.N API and addresses many of the traditional\u2014and often invisible!\u2014 pitfalls of writing Go benchmarks. The testing package also has new APIs that make it easy\n\n[Content truncated...]",

For some volume of sales that comes into the business, it gives an idea of what percentage is left as cash in the end. Barring some accounting shenanigans regarding where the bottom line is. The size of margins is often cited to explain how businesses behave: \"Amazon was incentivized to move to cloud hosting and AWS as a higher-margin business than retail, whereas Google could not have been the first mover in hosting because advertising has higher margins.\" It's a compelling story, though hard to prove definitively as an important part of the company's behavior. Here, let's instead look at some cold hard empirical data about operating margins of real companies. Using everyone's favorite website as the source, we get yearly operating margins of >10,000 public companies alongside business categories and market caps. We look at the last available year, 2025, and cluster by category. To summarize a category, we can straightforwardly take the median margin over all companies in the category. This produces some counterintuitive results, with for example Semiconductors showing a mediocre median margin of 10%. While this is a perfectly meaningful result, it obscures the fact that the category is dominated by a few large outlier companies with very high margins. And of course it's no coincidence that companies with high margins are the largest; those margins are what allowed them to grow in the first place, while their size conversely gives them pricing power and thus higher margins. We therefore also put in an average margin weighted by market cap. Using the weighted average, Semiconductors sits at an exceptional 42%. Here is an interactive plot of median vs weighted average margins for each category, where the size of the dot is the total market cap of companies in the category. The bulk of the companies sit at around a margin of 10%, bu\n\n[Content truncated...]",

This was based on systematic evaluations showing cyber capabilities doubling in six months; we\u2019d also been tracking real-world cyberattacks, observing how malicious actors were using AI capabilities. While we predicted these capabilities would continue to evolve, what has stood out to us is how quickly they have done so at scale.

The attackers used AI\u2019s \u201cagentic\u201d capabilities to an unprecedented degree\u2014using AI not just as an advisor, but to execute the cyberattacks themselves.

The operation targeted large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies. We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention. Upon detecting this activity, we immediately launched an investigation to understand its scope and nature. Over the following ten days, as we mapped the severity and full extent of the operation, we banned accounts as they were identified, notified affected entities as appropriate, and coordinated with authorities as we gathered actionable intelligence.

I already donated Remind me later Introducing an innovation space within the Blender project, where designers and developers can work together on challenging or future-facing projects, to keep Blender relevant in the years to come. Over the years, Blender has grown and matured into a powerful and complex piece of software. With its unstoppable release cycle, a massive, highly demanding, and diverse user community, natural technical debt, and complex technical dependencies, shipping new features and general improvements requires more and more effort and coordination. Software stability and reliability have become critical for individuals and companies. As a consequence, development efforts focus on those aspects, offering progressive improvements of existing functionality only when these are clear enhancements of what is already there. This makes it more challenging to innovate, think outside the box, experiment, and break things. To facilitate this essential aspect of product development, the Blender Foundation is establishing a new project: the Blender Lab. This is the innovation space where designers, developers, and researchers work together on challenging and future-facing projects that will help Blender stay relevant in the years to come.

We not only debate their technical merits and aesthetic qualities, but they become integrated into our personal identities, along with the values and traits that we associate with them. Some even defend a form of Linguistic Determinism that thinking is confined to what the language makes typable. Since we spend so much time writing code, a keen interest in language design is justified. However, the character of these discussions suggests that we think of them as much more, and have perhaps forgotten their primary role. Programming languages are implementation tools for instructing machines, not thinking tools for expressing ideas. They are strict formal systems riddled with design compromises and practical limitations. At the end of the day, we hope they make controlling computers bearable for humans. In contrast, thoughts are best expressed through a medium which is free and flexible. Thinking in Math The natural language which has been effectively used for thinking about computation, for thousands of years, is mathematics. Most people don\u2019t think of math as free or flexible.

Share \u2022 18 days ago \u2022 View on X Before we all mute the word 'dithering' I thought I'd explain a little bit about why we needed to dither digital images in the first place. Although it's an aesthetic now, we used to need dithering to trick our eyes into seeing more colors than were actually there. \ud83d\udc47 So in the early days of computing, memory was scarce and we couldn't store a lot of color detail. To get around this we used limited palettes with lookup tables or really low bit depth colors, to reduce the number of colors in an image, also called quantization. The problem with quantization is it creates hard steps where there should be gradual gradients - we don't have a color in between these. This is where dithering comes in. We can approximate this gradient by adding some noise with the two neighbouring colors. Dithering is effective because of something called spatial averaging - basically your eye takes an average of a small area of color. Dithering tricks our eyes into inferring a smooth step between the two banks of color, like a low pass filter. So how do we dither an image? Well there are quite a few approaches so lets start with the simple one, ordered dithering. For the sake of simplicity lets use a monochrome image. Our goal is to recreate the grey tones in the image using just black and white. To start, we create a 2x2 Bayer matrix, where the values are the order in which we will process the pixels. We then scale those values to the range we need, 0-255, which gives us a threshold map we can use to compare pixels against. Next, we divide the image into 2x2 pixel groups and compare each pixel value to the values in our map, in that weird criss-cross order. If it's higher than the value in our map, we turn it white and if it's lower we turn it black. Because we have a 2x2 matrix, there's actually only 5 possible results for any quadrant, which means there are only 3 shades of grey in between white and bl\n\n[Content truncated...]",

We know that security works best when it accounts for the diverse ways people use our tools. This is why we announced this change early: to gather input and ensure our solutions are balanced. We appreciate the community's engagement and have heard the early feedback \u2013 specifically from students and hobbyists who need an accessible path to learn, and from power users who are more comfortable with security risks. We are making changes to address the needs of both groups. To understand how these updates fit into our broader mission, it is important to first look at the specific threats we are tackling. Why verification is important Keeping users safe on Android is our top priority. Combating scams and digital fraud is not new for us \u2014 it has been a central focus of our work for years. From Scam Detection in Google Messages to Google Play Protect and real-time alerts for scam calls, we have consistently acted to keep our ecosystem safe . However, online scams and malware campaigns are becoming more aggressive. At the global scale of Android, this translates to real harm for people around the world \u2013 especially in rapidly digitizing regions where many are coming online for the first time. Technical safeguards are critical, but they cannot solve for every scenario where a user i\n\n[Content truncated...]",

That\u2019s why today, Kagi Search introduces the first community-driven system to detect and downrank deceptive AI-generated text, images, and video inside search results. It\u2019s 2025, and the internet we loved is drowning in AI-generated noise. Content farms exploiting AI for profit are manipulating search results in this attention economy\u2019s race to the bottom. This makes us wonder: who are we building the web for? What is AI \u201cSlop\u201d and how can we stop it? AI slop is deceptive or low-value AI-generated content, created to manipulate ranking or attention rather than help the reader. Per our AI integration philosophy , we\u2019re not against AI tools that enhance human creativity. But when it includes fake reviews, fabricated expertise, misinformation, content farms designed purely for profit rather than value, and systems that seek to replace genuine human insight and connection, we know it\u2019s hurting us, and we take it upon ourselves to act. Our ethos at Kagi is to put humans in control. We\u2019ve been fighting AI slop since we introduced our AI-generated image filter a year ago. Since our inception, we have actively downranked content filled with ads and trackers with little or no value to our members, prompting and enabling you to take control of your search experience. SlopStop now tackles the wider spectrum of misleading AI-generated content: videos, articles, domains, and everything in between. From now on, you will see a display within the search results showing the real-time AI slop score. As our CEO, Vlad, puts it: \u201cWe believe AI slop is an existential threat to an internet that should belong to humans. This is the first step towards our ultimate goal: to kill AI slop so you never see it again.\u201d This initiative will give you even greater c\n\n[Content truncated...]",

It\u2019s an accomplishment that will help the new rocket system become an option to send larger payloads to space, the moon, and beyond. Thursday\u2019s launch wasn\u2019t just about the landing attempt, though. Roughly 34 minutes after takeoff, the upper stage of New Glenn successfully deployed the rocket\u2019s first commercial payload: twin spacecraft for NASA that will travel to Mars to study the red planet\u2019s atmosphere. The pair of achievements are remarkable for the second-ever launch of such a massive rocket system. And it could put Blue Origin in position to compete with SpaceX, which dominates the world\u2019s launch market with its Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Starship rockets. The accomplishment is noteworthy for the broader space industry, and one that SpaceX CEO Gwynne Shotwell acknowledged via a post on social media site X with a simple \u201cMagnificent!\u201d Musk even offered his own congratulations shortly after. Magnificent! https://t.co/TTshvx2GNY \u2014 Gwynne Shotwell (@Gwynne_Shotwell) November 13, 2025 New Glenn\u2019s first launch was in January, and Blue Origin experienced a number of delays in getting the second rocket to launch. The company had hoped to make a second attempt as early as the spring, but pushed it back multiple times. New Glenn finally made it to the launch pad on Sunday, but weather and solar storms delayed it further. The rocket finally took off from Launch Complex 36 in Cape Canaveral, Florida on Thursday at around 3:55 p.m. ET. At about four minutes into the flight, the second stage separated and headed further into space, while the New Glenn booster began its journey back toward Earth. Roughly 10 minutes into the flight, the 189-foot-tall booster touched down on the platform. Techcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to th\n\n[Content truncated...]",

Our live payment processing platform was not impacted. No merchant funds or card numbers were accessed. We are donating the ransom amount to fund cybercrime research. Last week, Checkout.com was contacted by a criminal group known as \u201cShinyHunters\u201d, who claimed to have obtained data connected to Checkout.com and demanded a ransom. Upon investigation, we determined that this data was obtained by gaining unauthorized access to a legacy third-party cloud file storage system, used in 2020 and prior years. We estimate that this would affect less than 25% of our current merchant base. The system was used for internal operational documents and merchant onboarding materials at that time. This incident has not impacted our payment processing platform. The threat actors do not have, and never had, access to merchant funds or card numbers. The episode occurred when threat actors gained access to this third party legacy system which was not decommissioned properly. This was our mistake, and we take full responsibility. We are sorry. We regret that this incident has caused worry for our partners and people. We have begun the process to identify and contact those impacted and are\n\n[Content truncated...]",

Meanwhile I'm preparing user quotes from the last week to share out, and others add topics to the Discussions section.

This entire meeting is taking place inside Zed. Our weekly \"all hands\" Monday meeting in Zed Our mission from the beginning has been to engineer an editor that will be: Responsive : The latency between keystroke and re-render should be imperceptible. Focused : The interface should offer minimal distractions and stay out of the code's way. Collaborative : Working with teammates should feel no different than sitting next to them in the office. Setting the first two properties aside, let's focus on collaboration. Collaboration Built into Zed's DNA We've been dreaming of building the ultimate collaborative editor for years. The roots of this vision go back to Nathan's early days at Pivotal Labs , where pair programming with two keyboards plugged into the same computer was the standard practice. We set out to recreate that seamless collaboration experience\u2014but for distributed teams. But wait... doesn't this technology already exist in other editors? Yes! If you've been a developer long enough, you might recall the teletype package for Atom \u2014both built by Zed's founders.

This was based on systematic evaluations showing cyber capabilities doubling in six months; we\u2019d also been tracking real-world cyberattacks, observing how malicious actors were using AI capabilities. While we predicted these capabilities would continue to evolve, what has stood out to us is how quickly they have done so at scale. In mid-September 2025, we detected suspicious activity that later investigation determined to be a highly sophisticated espionage campaign. The attackers used AI\u2019s \u201cagentic\u201d capabilities to an unprecedented degree\u2014using AI not just as an advisor, but to execute the cyberattacks themselves. The threat actor\u2014whom we assess with high confidence was a Chinese state-sponsored group\u2014manipulated our Claude Code tool into attempting infiltration into roughly thirty global targets and succeeded in a small number of cases. The operation targeted large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies. We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention. Upon detecting this activity, we immediately launched an investigation to understand its scope and nature. Over the following ten days, as we mapped the severity and full extent of the operation, we banned accounts as they were identified, notified affected entities as appropriate, and coordinated with authorities as we gathered actionable intelligence. This campaign has substantial implications for cybersecurity in the age of AI \u201cagents\u201d\u2014systems that can be run autonomously for long periods of time and that complete complex tasks largely independent of human intervention.

Best-effort maintenance will continue until March 2026. Afterward, there will be no further releases, no bugfixes, and no updates to resolve any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered. Existing deployments of Ingress NGINX will continue to function and installation artifacts will remain available. We recommend migrating to one of the many alternatives. Consider migrating to Gateway API , the modern replacement for Ingress. If you must continue using Ingress, many alternative Ingress controllers are listed in the Kubernetes documentation . Continue reading for further information about the history and current state of Ingress NGINX, as well as next steps. About Ingress NGINX Ingress is the original user-friendly way to direct network traffic to workloads running on Kubernetes. ( Gateway API is a newer way to achieve many of the same goals.) In order for an Ingress to work in your cluster, there must be an Ingress controller running. There are many Ingress controller choices available, which serve the needs of different users and use cases. Some are cloud-provider specific, while others have more general applicability. Ingress NGINX was an Ingress controller, developed early in the history of the Kubernetes project as an example implementation of the API. It became very popular due to its tremendous flexibility, breadth of features, and independence from any particular cloud or infrastructure provider. Since those days, many other Ingress controllers have been created within the Kubernetes project by community groups, and by cloud native vendors. Ingress NGINX has continued to be one of the most popular, deployed as part of many hosted Kubernetes platforms and within innumerable\n\n[Content truncated...]",

We not only debate their technical merits and aesthetic qualities, but they become integrated into our personal identities, along with the values and traits that we associate with them. Some even defend a form of Linguistic Determinism that thinking is confined to what the language makes typable. Since we spend so much time writing code, a keen interest in language design is justified. However, the character of these discussions suggests that we think of them as much more, and have perhaps forgotten their primary role. Programming languages are implementation tools for instructing machines, not thinking tools for expressing ideas. They are strict formal systems riddled with design compromises and practical limitations. At the end of the day, we hope they make controlling computers bearable for humans. In contrast, thoughts are best expressed through a medium which is free and flexible. Thinking in Math The natural language which has been effectively used for thinking about computation, for thousands of years, is mathematics. Most people don\u2019t think of math as free or flexible. They think of scary symbols and memorizing steps to regurgitate on tests. Others hear math and think category theory, lambda calculus, or other methods of formalizing computation itself, but these are hardly necessary for programming itself. I hope readers of this article have had a better experience regarding what math is about, such as a graph theory, algorithms, or linear algebra course; the kind that involves logic and theorems, and is written in prose with a mix of symbols (most symbols weren\u2019t even invented until the 16th century ). This kind of math is about creating logical models to understand real world problems, through careful definitions and deductions.

Blender has been there for your projects, your learning, your art, your business. Today, we're asking for $5. That's it. If every active Blender user contributed $5 this month, Blender Foundation would meet its entire yearly funding goal for 2026. I already donated Remind me later Introducing an innovation space within the Blender project, where designers and developers can work together on challenging or future-facing projects, to keep Blender relevant in the years to come. Over the years, Blender has grown and matured into a powerful and complex piece of software. With its unstoppable release cycle, a massive, highly demanding, and diverse user community, natural technical debt, and complex technical dependencies, shipping new features and general improvements requires more and more effort and coordination. Software stability and reliability have become critical for individuals and companies. As a consequence, development efforts focus on those aspects, offering progressive improvements of existing functionality only when these are clear enhancements of what is already there. This makes it more challenging to innovate, think outside the box, experiment, and break things. To facilitate this essential aspect of product development, the Blender Foundation is establishing a new project: the Blender Lab. This is the innovation space where designers, developers, and researchers work together on challenging and future-facing projects that will help Blender stay relevant in the years to come.

It\u2019s an accomplishment that will help the new rocket system become an option to send larger payloads to space, the moon, and beyond. Thursday\u2019s launch wasn\u2019t just about the landing attempt, though.

The company had hoped to make a second attempt as early as the spring, but pushed it back multiple times. New Glenn finally made it to the launch pad on Sunday, but weather and solar storms delayed it further. The rocket finally took off from Launch Complex 36 in Cape Canaveral, Florida on Thursday at around 3:55 p.m. ET.

We know that security works best when it accounts for the diverse ways people use our tools. This is why we announced this change early: to gather input and ensure our solutions are balanced. We appreciate the community's engagement and have heard the early feedback \u2013 specifically from students and hobbyists who need an accessible path to learn, and from power users who are more comfortable with security risks. We are making changes to address the needs of both groups. To understand how these updates fit into our broader mission, it is important to first look at the specific threats we are tackling. Why verification is important Keeping users safe on Android is our top priority. Combating scams and digital fraud is not new for us \u2014 it has been a central focus of our work for years. From Scam Detection in Google Messages to Google Play Protect and real-time alerts for scam calls, we have consistently acted to keep our ecosystem safe . However, online scams and malware campaigns are becoming more aggressive. At the global scale of Android, this translates to real harm for people around the world \u2013 especially in rapidly digitizing regions where many are coming online for the first time.

Our weekly \"all hands\" Monday meeting in Zed Our mission from the beginning has been to engineer an editor that will be: Responsive : The latency between keystroke and re-render should be imperceptible. Focused : The interface should offer minimal distractions and stay out of the code's way. Collaborative : Working with teammates should feel no different than sitting next to them in the office. Setting the first two properties aside, let's focus on collaboration. Collaboration Built into Zed's DNA We've been dreaming of building the ultimate collaborative editor for years. The roots of this vision go back to Nathan's early days at Pivotal Labs , where pair programming with two keyboards plugged into the same computer was the standard practice.

Our live payment processing platform was not impacted. No merchant funds or card numbers were accessed. We are donating the ransom amount to fund cybercrime research. Last week, Checkout.com was contacted by a criminal group known as \u201cShinyHunters\u201d, who claimed to have obtained data connected to Checkout.com and demanded a ransom. Upon investigation, we determined that this data was obtained by gaining unauthorized access to a legacy third-party cloud file storage system, used in 2020 and prior years. We estimate that this would affect less than 25% of our current merchant base. The system was used for internal operational documents and merchant onboarding materials at that time. This incident has not impacted our payment processing platform. The threat actors do not have, and never had, access to merchant funds or card numbers. The episode occurred when threat actors gained access to this third party legacy system which was not decommissioned properly. This was our mistake, and we take full responsibility. We are sorry.

      "content": "Heartbeats in Distributed Systems Arpit Bhayani curious, tinkerer, and explorer In distributed systems, one of the fundamental challenges is knowing whether a node or service is alive and functioning properly. Unlike monolithic applications, where everything runs in a single process, distributed systems span multiple machines, networks, and data centers. This becomes even glaring when the nodes are geographically separated. This is where heartbeat mechanisms come into play. Imagine a cluster of servers working together to process millions of requests per day. If one server silently crashes, how quickly can the system detect this failure and react? How do we distinguish between a truly dead server and one that is just temporarily slow due to network congestion? These questions form the core of why heartbeat mechanisms matter. What are Heartbeat Messages At its most basic level, a heartbeat is a periodic signal sent from one component in a distributed system to another to indicate that the sender is still alive and functioning. Think of it as a simple message that says \u201cI am alive!\u201d Heartbeat messages are typically small and lightweight, often containing just a timestamp, a sequence number, or an identifier. The key characteristic is that they are sent regularly at fixed intervals, creating a predictable pattern that other components can monitor. The mechanism works through a simple contract between two parties: the sender and the receiver. The sender commits to broadcasting its heartbeat at regular intervals, say every 2 seconds. The receiver monitors these incoming heartbeats and maintains a record of when the last heartbeat was received. If the receiver does not hear from the sender within an expected timeframe, it can reasonably assume something has gone wrong. class HeartbeatSender : def __init__ (self, interval_seconds): self .interval = interval_seconds self .sequence_number = 0 def send_heartbeat (self, target): message = { 'node_id' : self .get_node_id(), 'ti\n\n[Content truncated...]",

The online version has been available since 2001, and now there is also a throughly revised version available in book form . We wanted to do two things with this course. First, we wanted to provide a text that was relatively self contained, a text that would permit someone with little or no knowledge of computing to pick up the basics of Prolog with the minimum of fuss. We also wanted the text to be clear enough to make it useful for self study. We believe that if you read the text, and do the associated exercises, you will gain a useful partial entry to the world of Prolog. But only a partial entry, and this brings us to our second point. We want to emphasize the practical aspects of Prolog. Prolog is something you do. You can't learn a programming language simply by reading about it, and if you really want to get the most out of this course, we strongly advise you to get hold of a Prolog interpreter (you'll find pointers to some nice ones on this website) and work through all the Practical Sessions that we provide.

That stat could help attract a whole new group of users who need to travel between the many towns and suburbs within the greater San Francisco Bay Area or quicken commutes across the sprawling Los Angeles and Phoenix metro areas. Using freeways is also essential for Waymo to offer rides to and from the San Francisco Airport, a location the company is currently testing in.

Some analysts call its $273 million IPO the last successful tech IPO until the Google IPO in 2004 . Transmeta didn\u2019t completely fit in to the dotcom era, because they were a hardware company. But they were still a technology company, and if their plans had gone well, they would have sold their product to dotcoms, but it didn\u2019t work out that way for them. In this blog post we explore what happened to Transmeta. Was Transmeta truly the last of the dotcoms? Transmeta was a CPU company, a pure technology play as investors cooled on Internet companies. Its IPO feels like the end of the dotcom era, even though the line feels a bit fuzzy.. I\u2019ve heard Transmeta called the last successful IPO of the dotcom era, or the last of the big dotcom IPOs. But it\u2019s an oversimplification to say there weren\u2019t any successful technology IPOs between Transmeta and Google. One very notable exception is Paypal, who ran an IPO in February 2002 that raised $70.2 million. The Register even hailed Paypal as the return of the Internet IPO. And it wasn\u2019t just that dotcom IPOs grew scarce after November 2000. On February 7, 2002, Forbes stated that only 34 IPOs in total launched between September 11, 2001 and February 6, 2002, compared to 87 in the same-year-earlier period, and 240 between September 11, 1999 and February 6, 2000. That date is significant. Any bad news can spook investors, and the 9/11 attack did, in fact, spook investors. So where the dotcom-era ended is a fuzzy line, but it makes sense to draw the line at Transmeta. Technology IPOs and particularly Internet IPOs became much more scarce after Transmeta, and the size of the IPOs shrunk too. The distinction of Transmeta being a technology stock, rather than an Internet stock, also suggests investors were already cooling on Internet stoc\n\n[Content truncated...]"

LeCun, a Turing Award-winning pioneer of modern AI, has begun early fundraising discussions for his new venture, which will focus on developing \"world models,\" next-generation systems designed to learn from visual and spatial data rather than text. These models aim to replicate human reasoning and understanding of the physical world, a project LeCun has said could take a decade to mature. LeCun's exit comes amid an internal overhaul of Meta's AI strategy. Zuckerberg has shifted Meta's Fundamental AI Research Lab - FAIR, which LeCun founded in 2013, away from long-term research toward commercial AI products and large language models - LLMs. The move follows the underwhelming release of Meta's Llama 4 model, which lagged behind rival offerings from Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI. To accelerate progress, Zuckerberg recently hired Alexandr Wang, founder of Scale AI, paying $14.3 billion for a 49 percent stake in his company and appointing him to lead Meta's new Superintelligence division, to which LeCun now reports. The CEO also formed an elite team called TBD Lab, offering $100 million pay packages to lure top AI talent from competitors.

The new Bluetooth Core 6.2 specification also introduces various BLE Test Mode enhancements. If you feel like Bluetooth specifications are released more often than in the past, that\u2019s normal because the Bluetooth SIG switched to a bi-annual release schedule. For instance, the Bluetooth 6.1 specification was just published last May, or about 6 months ago\u2026 Bluetooth 6.2 highlights: Bluetooth Shorter Connection Intervals (SCI) reduce the minimum Bluetooth LE connection interval from 7.5 ms to just 375 \u00b5s for faster responsiveness. The change will especially impact high-performance HID devices, real-time human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and latency-sensitive sensors. AR/VR and gaming applications will particularly benefit from the lower latency. Bluetooth Channel Sounding Amplitude-based Attack Resilience adds protections against sophisticated amplitude-based RF attacks. Devices for the automotive, smart home, and industrial markets will become less prone to relay and spoofing threats with the changes.

LeCun, a Turing Award-winning pioneer of modern AI, has begun early fundraising discussions for his new venture, which will focus on developing \"world models,\" next-generation systems designed to learn from visual and spatial data rather than text. These models aim to replicate human reasoning and understanding of the physical world, a project LeCun has said could take a decade to mature. LeCun's exit comes amid an internal overhaul of Meta's AI strategy. Zuckerberg has shifted Meta's Fundamental AI Research Lab - FAIR, which LeCun founded in 2013, away from long-term research toward commercial AI products and large language models - LLMs. The move follows the underwhelming release of Meta's Llama 4 model, which lagged behind rival offerings from Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI. To accelerate progress, Zuckerberg recently hired Alexandr Wang, founder of Scale AI, paying $14.3 billion for a 49 percent stake in his company and appointing him to lead Meta's new Superintelligence division, to which LeCun now reports. The CEO also formed an elite team called TBD Lab, offering $100 million pay packages to lure top AI talent from competitors.

The new Bluetooth Core 6.2 specification also introduces various BLE Test Mode enhancements. If you feel like Bluetooth specifications are released more often than in the past, that\u2019s normal because the Bluetooth SIG switched to a bi-annual release schedule. For instance, the Bluetooth 6.1 specification was just published last May, or about 6 months ago\u2026 Bluetooth 6.2 highlights: Bluetooth Shorter Connection Intervals (SCI) reduce the minimum Bluetooth LE connection interval from 7.5 ms to just 375 \u00b5s for faster responsiveness. The change will especially impact high-performance HID devices, real-time human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and latency-sensitive sensors. AR/VR and gaming applications will particularly benefit from the lower latency. Bluetooth Channel Sounding Amplitude-based Attack Resilience adds protections against sophisticated amplitude-based RF attacks. Devices for the automotive, smart home, and industrial markets will become less prone to relay and spoofing threats with the changes.

      "content": "diamond geezer Tuesday, November 11, 2025 There are many places around the City of London to see its old Roman Wall , notably alongside Noble Street, in Barber Surgeons' Meadow, through the Barbican, in St Alphage Garden and just outside the entrance to Tower Hill station. Here are four of the odder spots. Four strange places to see London's Roman Wall 1) From platform 1 at Tower Hill station If you're ever waiting for a westbound train at Tower Hill station, take a walk to the rear of the platform and take a look across the tracks, roughly where the penultimate carriage would stop. High on the far wall is a square recess lined by black tiles, and at the back of that is a dimly-lit surface of chunky irregular blocks. Unlike every single other thing on the Underground, the Romans built that. London's original wall was 2 miles long, 6 metres high and almost 3 metres thick at its base, all the better to keep out uncivilised marauders. It was built around 200 AD, then left to decay and rebuilt in the medieval era, again for defensive purposes. This is one of the original bits, not that you can easily tell by squinting across the tracks. A small metal lamp points inwards but is no longer switched on because heritage illumination is not a TfL priority. There is however a rather nice silver plaque on the pillar opposite, should you step back far enough to notice it. The plaque confirms that the stones here are a continuation of the wall seen (much more clearly) outside. What it doesn't mention is the unavoidable truth that the wall must once have continued across the tracks and platforms but is no longer here. That's because when the Circle line was constructed in 1882 the railway companies had permission to demolish 22 metres of London's wall and duly did, the Victorians never being afraid to destroy ancient heritage. Ian Visits has a photo of navvies standing atop the offending stonework just before they bashed it through. The square hole is no recompense, plus you can't\n\n[Content truncated...]"

It is an early build with rough edges, but it proves the point: MAUI can now run on every major desktop OS and in the browser. What is the Avalonia MAUI Backend? At its core, the Avalonia MAUI Backend enables you to keep your MAUI codebase while replacing the rendering layer with Avalonia. The goal is straightforward: take your existing MAUI applications and extend them to additional platforms, while enhancing desktop performance along the way. In practical terms, that means several big wins. Desktop Linux support .NET MAUI apps running as first class desktop apps on distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora, sharing the same Avalonia renderer that already powers demanding desktop apps in production today. Embedded Linux Avalonia already runs on embedded Linux devices, from Raspberry Pi panels to industrial HMIs. Using the same backend, the Avalonia MAUI Backend brings those capabilities to MAUI as well, so the applications you build in MAUI can run on the same embedded Linux targets as Avalonia. WebAssembly support The demo you can open in your browser today is a real MAUI application running on WebAssembly, rendered by Avalonia, with no native dependencies on the client. It is an early build, but it demonstrates what is now possible. MAUI apps will soon be free to deploy to the browser. Bonus: The Avalonia MAUI Backend runs on Windows a\n\n[Content truncated...]"

I opened it and I saw that it has updated to Goodnotes 6. I looked through the changelogs, and what? There are AI-integrated features now, which, as far as I\u2019m aware, can\u2019t be turned off. 1 And the option to buy a lifetime license? Gone. I bought the previous \u201clifetime\u201d version of the app, but for WHAT, since I have to pay for the subscription to access the newest features. Sure, I can switch back to the outdated version, but if I had known this would happen, I would\u2019ve just gone for the yearly subscription (even though I try to avoid them). It would\u2019ve been cheaper anyway. Sadly, everything is going in this direction. You can have a subscription for almost everything now. From food delivery apps to beer subscription. Companies prey on those who forget to cancel their free trial. So far, it only happened once to me, but thankfully, I managed to get my refund. But not everyone might feel like going through the refund process, because companies make it intentionally hard by creating friction - hiding it deep into their websites or adding extra unnecessary steps like forcing you to reach out to the support. People might just sigh, mutter \u201cthis bloody subscription rahhh,\u201d and cancel it so it won\u2019t charge them again. It\u2019s funny how \u201cownership\u201d in the digital world has become an illusion. You don\u2019t really own your apps, your music, or even your tools anymore. You\u2019re just renting access until someone decides to move the paywall. It\u2019s convenient, sure, but it also feels like losing control over something that used to be ours. Market values steady revenue streams over fair ownership. The subscription model rewards companies not for making better products, but for finding better ways to keep us paying indefinitely.

The final result is concealed entirely within the fan\u2019s housing, leaving no visible modification. If you\u2019re interested in building one yourself, the schematic, BoM , and PCB design are all available here . In terms of firmware, I used ESPHome with an external component, for which the source code is available here . The rest of this post covers the research and development that went into the project. The underside of the modified fan, boasting a larger, more advanced PCB than the original. How it began When I first bought this fan I chose it because it uses a DC motor which, compared to AC counterparts, use less power, and run quieter. By adding a smart plug between it and a power outlet, I could give it a basic form of on/off remote control. But this presented a problem: If I wanted to adjust the speed I would have to physically interact with the fan! Obviously, I needed to see what could be done about this, and so I took a look at the inside of the fan. Six screws later, and I was greeted with a surprisingly spacious interior. Inside were two components: An AC-DC converter A small PCB which held the potentiometer used for the speed control dial Everything joined up via a 2-pin and 5-pin connector on the PCB. From there, it was a straightforward matter of measuring voltages and continuity to work out what connected to what: the 2-pin connector was offering 24V DC. The 5-pin connector was what went off to the motor itself. Two of its pins were passing through the 24V DC and ground directly. Two more pins were connected to the potentiometer. The fifth pin was not connected. With this, I concluded that the variable resistance between the two potentiometer pins is used to control the speed of the motor. From here the idea started to form: if I could produce a variable resistance digitally, I could control it r\n\n[Content truncated...]"

Working on market-leading apps such as Camera+, Photon and REC , we\u2019ve always had our finger on the pulse on what users want out of their mobile photography.

It uses modern security features like UEFI Secure Boot and TPM to provide a safe boot experience and seamless full disk encryption. Updates are applied atomically using an A/B scheme allowing for an easy revert in case of problems. The system itself is completely locked down with no local or remote shell, only an authenticated REST API to access Incus and manage the OS through it. IncusOS is ideal for anyone who's focused on building and running infrastructure on top of Incus and wants the underlying infrastructure to be reliable and easy to update. All IncusOS servers are guaranteed to be running bit for bit the same software, eliminating any deployment variance and making it trivial to scale or re-deploy even large number of servers.

They really do think someone, perhaps them, will build AGI, and that it will lead to either the flourishing or destruction of humanity. Elon Musk founded OpenAI because he thought Demis Hassabis was an evil genius who would build AGI first: \u2026Musk would regularly characterise Hassabis as a supervillain who needed to be stopped. Musk would make unequivocally clear that OpenAI was the good to DeepMind\u2019s evil. \u2026 \u201cHe literally made a video game where an evil genius tries to create AI to take over the world,\u201d Musk shouted [at an OpenAI off-site], referring to Hassabis\u2019s 2004 title Evil Genius , \u201cand fucking people don\u2019t see it. Fucking people don\u2019t see it! And Larry [Page]? Larry thinks he controls Demis but he\u2019s too busy fucking windsurfing to realize that Demis is gathering the power.\u201d OpenAI\u2019s co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever regularly told audiences and employees to \u201cfeel the AGI\u201d. At a company off-site in Yosemite in September 2022, employees gathered around a firepit: In the pit, [Sutskever] had placed a wooden effigy that he\u2019d commissioned from a local artist, and began a dramatic performance. This effigy, he explained represented a good, aligned AGI that OpenAI had built, only to discover it was actually lying and deceitful. OpenAI\u2019s duty, he said, was to destroy it. \u2026 Sutskever doused the effigy in lighter fluid and lit on fire. I think it\u2019s remarkable that what was until recently sci-fi fantasy has become a mainstream view in Silicon Valley. Hao writes that GPT-2 was a bet on the \u201cpure language\u201d hypothesis, that asserts that since we communicate through language, then AGI should emerge from training a model solely on language. This is contrast to the \u201cgrounding\u201d hypothesis, that asserts an AGI needs to perceive the world.

To mitigate it, our company created an analytics department solely focused on categorizing warranty claims into actionable problems. For decades, this team has relied on SQL queries to classify warranty data. But vehicles\u2014and the language used to describe them\u2014have evolved. SQL struggles with semantics, negations, and contextual nuance. Here\u2019s a fictional example of a claim we might see in the wild: \u201cCustomer reports oil on driveway, thought engine leak. Detailed inspection found no engine leaks. Traced oil to spill during last oil change. Oil on subframe dripping to ground. Cleaned subframe, verified no leaks from engine or drain plug. Customer advised.\u201d An oversimplified SQL query that might try and capture this scenario: SELECT claim_id , claim_text , CASE WHEN ( ( LOWER ( claim_text ) LIKE '%leak%' OR LOWER ( claim_text ) LIKE '%leaking%' OR LOWER ( claim_text ) LIKE '%seep%' AND ( LOWER ( claim_text ) LIKE '%oil%' OR LOWER ( claim_text ) LIKE '%fluid%' AND LOWER ( claim_text ) NOT LIKE '%no leak%' AND LOWER ( claim_text ) NOT LIKE '%not leaking%' ) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_leak FROM warranty_claims ; What we can gather from this example is that the leak came from a service oil spill\u2014not the vehicle. Yet this query would still flag it as a leak. In production, these types of queries balloon into hundreds\u2014if not thousands\u2014of similar clauses. Over the years, the team created thousands of classification buckets. Many of these legacy buckets still siphon off claims today\u2014creating unnecessary work for analysts and slowing down the detection of new issues.

For some volume of sales that comes into the business, it gives an idea of what percentage is left as cash in the end. Barring some accounting shenanigans regarding where the bottom line is. The size of margins is often cited to explain how businesses behave: \"Amazon was incentivized to move to cloud hosting and AWS as a higher-margin business than retail, whereas Google could not have been the first mover in hosting because advertising has higher margins.\" It's a compelling story, though hard to prove definitively as an important part of the company's behavior. Here, let's instead look at some cold hard empirical data about operating margins of real companies. Using everyone's favorite website as the source, we get yearly operating margins of >10,000 public companies alongside business categories and market caps. We look at the last available year, 2025, and cluster by category. To summarize a category, we can straightforwardly take the median margin over all companies in the category. This produces some counterintuitive results, with for example Semiconductors showing a mediocre median margin of 10%. While this is a perfectly meaningful result, it obscures the fact that the category is dominated by a few large outlier companies with very high margins. And of course it's no coincidence that companies with high margins are the largest; those margins are what allowed them to grow in the first place, while their size conversely gives them pricing power and thus higher margins. We therefore also put in an average margin weighted by market cap. Using the weighted average, Semiconductors sits at an exceptional 42%. Here is an interactive plot of median vs weighted average margins for each category, where the size of the dot is the total market cap of companies in the category. The bulk of the companies sit at around a margin of 10%, bu\n\n[Content truncated...]",

Everyone has experienced being broke. Being broke sucks. You are watching every dollar spent, finding wayys to trim or make things stretch until the next payday. The difference is when you are broke you have some money . You can afford to put gas in your car, but not enough to do that repair. Money is tight, but you can get the basics at the grocery store.

There is no room for errors as the punishment for mistakes is astronomical. When you hit an obstacle you don\u2019t restart from the last checkpoint, you go back to the beginning. There is this mindset from folks that poor people must not be smart. I mean, you\u2019re smart and you\u2019re not poor! The problem must be a skill issue! Learn the skills to do it yourself and you\u2019ll be able to pull yourself up. The other mindset is poor people are lazy. Quit complaining and do it yourself! Just get a better job! Get a second job! There\u2019s money out there, you just have to go get it. The last is these folks think they understand what it is like to be poor.

As puzzling as it might seem, the common problem with production changes is the ever-present \"AHA\" moment when things start slowing down or crashing straight away. Testing isn't easy as it is, but there's a widespread practice gap when it comes to testing SQL queries. Some might pretend to \"fix it\" by using ORMs to abstract away the problem. Others treat SQL as \"just glue code\" that doesn't deserve systematic testing. Most settle for integration tests that verify the application layer works, never actually testing whether their queries will survive the next schema change or index modification. For PostgreSQL development itself, the project has a robust regression test suite that has been preventing disasters in core development for decades. The database itself knows how to test SQL systematically - we just don't use those same techniques for our own queries. Enter RegreSQL , a tool originally created by Dimitri Fontaine for The Art of PostgreSQL book (which is excellent for understanding and mastering PostgreSQL as a database system), designed to bring the same regression testing framework to our application queries. I've been trying to use it for some time, but due to missing features and limitations gave up several times. Until now. I decided to fork the project and spend the time needed to take it to the next level. Introduction # The RegreSQL promise starts with the biggest strength and perceived weakness of SQL queries.

Sunspot region 4274 produced its strongest solar flare thus far since it appeared on the east limb and the sixth strongest solar flare of the current solar cycle. An impressive long duration and highly eruptive X5.1 (R3-strong) solar flare peaked this morning at 10:04 UTC.\nIt became quickly clear that the eruption would be followed by an impressive coronal mass ejection (CME). The resulting coronal wave following the solar explosion as well as the coronal dimming observed as the CME was propelled into space were of a spectacular magnitude as can be seen in the animation below provided by\nhalocme\n.\nAnother eruption from AR12474, associated with an X5.1 flare.

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that this plasma cloud of course has an earth-directed component and it is pretty clear that this will be a strong impact when it arrives at our planet. This rightfully so prompted the NOAA SWPC to issue a G4 or greater geomagnetic storm watch for tomorrow as the cloud could impact our planet as early as 16 UTC on 12 November. Not only is the CME fast but it will also travel trough an area with high ambient solar wind speed and low density thanks to two other CMEs released earlier by this region.

It is time to show you what we have been building.\nTry It Right Now\nBefore we dive into the details, you can experience it yourself:\nLaunch MAUI in your browser \u00e2\u0086\u0092\nThis is a real MAUI application running on WebAssembly, rendered through Avalonia, with no plugins or hidden tricks. It is an early build with rough edges, but it proves the point: MAUI can now run on every major desktop OS and in the browser.\nWhat is the Avalonia MAUI Backend?\nAt its core, the Avalonia MAUI Backend enables you to keep your MAUI codebase while replacing the rendering layer with Avalonia. The goal is straightforward: take your existing MAUI applications and extend them to additional platforms, while enhancing desktop performance along the way.\nIn practical terms, that means several big wins.\nDesktop Linux support\n.NET MAUI apps running as first class desktop apps on distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora, sharing the same Avalonia renderer that already powers demanding desktop apps in production today.\nEmbedded Linux\nAvalonia already runs on embedded Linux devices, from Raspberry Pi panels to industrial HMIs. Using the same backend, the Avalonia MAUI Backend brings those capabilities to MAUI as well, so the applications you build in MAUI can run on the same embedded Linux targets as Avalonia.\nWebAssembly support\nThe demo you can open in your browser today is a real MAUI application running on WebAssembly, rendered by Avalonia, with no native dependencies on the client. It is an early build, but it demonstrates what is now possible. MAUI apps will soon be free to deploy to the browser.\nBonus: The Avalonia MAUI Backend runs on Windows\n\n[Content truncated...]"

Here are four of the odder spots.\nFour strange places to see London's Roman Wall\n1) From platform 1 at Tower Hill station\nIf you're ever waiting for a westbound train at Tower Hill station, take a walk to the rear of the platform and take a look across the tracks, roughly where the penultimate carriage would stop. High on the far wall is a square recess lined by black tiles, and at the back of that is a dimly-lit surface of chunky irregular blocks. Unlike every single other thing on the Underground, the Romans built that.\nLondon's original wall was 2 miles long, 6 metres high and almost 3 metres thick at its base, all the better to keep out uncivilised marauders. It was built around 200 AD, then left to decay and rebuilt in the medieval era, again for defensive purposes. This is one of the original bits, not that you can easily tell by squinting across the tracks. A small metal lamp points inwards but is no longer switched on because heritage illumination is not a TfL priority. There is however a rather nice silver plaque on the pillar opposite, should you step back far enough to notice it.\nThe plaque confirms that the stones here are a continuation of the wall seen (much more clearly) outside. What it doesn't mention is the unavoidable truth that the wall must once have continued across the tracks and platforms but is no longer here. That's because when the Circle line was constructed in 1882 the railway companies had permission to demolish 22 metres of London's wall and duly did, the Victorians never being afraid to destroy ancient heritage.\nIan Visits\nhas a photo of navvies standing atop the offending stonework just before they bashed it through.

The final result is concealed entirely within the fan\u2019s housing, leaving no visible modification.\nIf you\u2019re interested in building one yourself, the schematic,\nBoM\n, and\nPCB\ndesign are all available\nhere\n. In terms of firmware, I used\nESPHome\nwith an external component, for which the source code is available\nhere\n. The rest of this post covers the research and development that went into the project.\nThe underside of the modified fan, boasting a larger, more advanced PCB than the original.\nHow it began\nWhen I first bought this fan I chose it because it uses a DC motor which, compared to AC counterparts, use less power, and run quieter. By adding a smart plug between it and a power outlet, I could give it a basic form of on/off remote control. But this presented a problem: If I wanted to adjust the speed I would have to physically interact with the fan!\nObviously, I needed to see what could be done about this, and so I took a look at the inside of the fan. Six screws later, and I was greeted with a surprisingly spacious interior.\nInside were two components:\nAn AC-DC converter\nA small PCB which held the potentiometer used for the speed control dial\nEverything joined up via a 2-pin and 5-pin connector on the PCB. From there, it was a straightforward matter of measuring voltages and continuity to work out what connected to what: the 2-pin connector was offering 24V DC. The 5-pin connector was what went off to the motor itself. Two of its pins were passing through the 24V DC and ground directly. Two more pins were connected to the potentiometer. The fifth pin was not connected.\nWith this, I concluded that the variable resistance between the two potentiometer pins is used to control the speed of the motor. From here the idea started to form: if I could produce a variable resistance digitally, I could control it r\n\n[Content truncated...]"

We\u2019re in it to delight our users, not just capture market share and sell them out. When considering AI projects, one thing has been clear \u2013 we can\u2019t take the AI startup road where you have a generous free tier, charge an unreasonably small monthly fee for \u201cunlimited\u201d, and hope you\u2019re going to make it up on scale (code for \u201csomeone please acquire us\u201d).\nAll the AI-focused billing systems we could find out there were based on this. Assuming you want to claim unlimited access, and then sandbag users with \u201cfair use\u201d clauses and prevent them from any actual unlimited usage (which is, obviously, untenable, since you\u2019ll end up with one $20/mo user reselling to everyone else).\nSince we want to fairly charge our customers for what they actually use, we\u2019ve built a credit-based \u201cpay per generation\u201d-style billing system (that internally we\u2019ve been calling CreditProxy).

      "description": "I\u2019ve been working in fairly locked\u2011down Windows environments where I\u2019m allowed to run Python, but not install or launch new `.exe` files. In addition the built-in windows dictations are blocked (the only good one isn&#x27;t local anyway). At the same time, I really wanted accurate, fast dictation without sending audio to a cloud service, and without needing a GPU. Most speech\u2011to\u2011text setups I tried either required special launchers, GPU access, or were awkward to run day\u2011to\u2011day.<p>To scratch that itch, I built Chirp, a Windows dictation app that runs fully locally, uses NVIDIA\u2019s ParakeetV3 model, and is managed end\u2011to\u2011end with `uv`. If you can run Python on your machine, you should be able to run Chirp\u2014no additional executables required.<p>Under the hood, Chirp uses the Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 ONNX bundle. ParakeetV3 has accuracy in the same ballpark as Whisper\u2011large\u2011v3 (multilingual WER ~4.9 vs ~5.0 in the open ASR leaderboard), but it\u2019s much faster and happy on CPU.<p>The flow is:\n- One\u2011time setup that downloads and prepares the ONNX model:\n  - `uv run python -m chirp.setup`\n- A long\u2011running CLI process:\n  - `uv run python -m chirp.main`\n- A global hotkey that starts&#x2F;stops recording and injects text into the active window.<p>A few details that might be interesting technically:<p>- <i>Local\u2011only STT:</i> Everything runs on your machine using ONNX Runtime; by default it uses CPU providers, with optional GPU providers if your environment allows.<p>- <i>Config\u2011driven behavior:</i> A `config.toml` file controls the global hotkey, model choice, quantization (`int8` option), language, ONNX providers, and threading. There\u2019s also a simple `[word_overrides]` map so you can fix tokens that the model consistently mishears.<p>- <i>Post\u2011processing pipeline:</i> After recognition, there\u2019s an optional \u201cstyle guide\u201d step where you can specify prompts like \u201csentence case\u201d or \u201cprepend: &gt;&gt;\u201d for the final text.<p>- <i>No clipboard gymnastics required on Windows:</i> The app types directly into the focused window; there are options for clipboard\u2011based pasting and cleanup behavior for platforms where that makes more sense.<p>- <i>Audio feedback:</i> Start&#x2F;stop sounds (configurable) let you know when the mic is actually recording.<p>So far I\u2019ve mainly tested this on my own Windows machines with English dictation and CPU\u2011only setups. There are probably plenty of rough edges (different keyboard layouts, language settings, corporate IT policies, etc.), and I\u2019d love feedback from people who:<p>- Work in restricted corporate environments and need local dictation.\n- Have experience with Parakeet&#x2F;Whisper or ONNX Runtime and see obvious ways to improve performance or robustness.\n- Want specific features (e.g., better multi\u2011language support, more advanced post\u2011processing, or integrations with their editor&#x2F;IDE).<p>Repo is here:  \n`<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Whamp&#x2F;chirp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Whamp&#x2F;chirp</a>`<p>If you try it, I\u2019d be very interested in:<p>- CPU usage and latency on your hardware,\n- How well it behaves with your keyboard layout and applications,\n- Any weird failure cases or usability annoyances you run into.<p>Happy to answer questions and dig into technical details in the comments.",

While it promises structure for AI-driven programming, it risks burying agility under layers of Markdown. This post explores why a more iterative, natural-language approach may better fit modern development. The Rise of Specification Coding assistants are intimidating: instead of an IDE full of familiar menus and buttons, developers are left with a simple chat input. How can we ensure that the code is correct with so little guidance? To help people write good software with coding assistants, the open-source community designed a clever way to guide a coding agent. Based on an initial prompt and a few instructions, an LLM generates product specifications, an implementation plan, and a detailed list of tasks. Each document depends on the previous one, and users can edit the documents to refine the spec. Eventually, these documents are handed over to a coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, you name it). The agent, now properly guided, should write solid code that satisfies the business requirements. This approach is called Spec-Driven Development (SDD), and several toolkits can get you started. To name a few: Spec-Kit by GitHub Kiro by AWS Tessl by Tessl BMad Method (BMM) by BMad Code If you want a comparison of these tools, I recommend the excellent article Understanding Spec-Driven-Development: Kiro, spec-kit, and Tessl by Birgitta B\u00f6ckeler. The Markdown Awakens How does a spec look? It\u2019s essentially a bunch of Markdown files. Here\u2019s an example using GitHub\u2019s spec-kit, where a developer wanted to display the current date on a time-tracking app, resulting in 8 files and 1,300 lines of text : Here\u2019s another example using\n\n[Content truncated...]",

It\u2019s an age verification bill that requires all websites distributing material that could conceivably be deemed \u201csexual content\u201d to both implement an age verification system and also to block the access of users connected via VPN. The bill seeks to broadly expand the definition of materials that are \u201charmful to minors\u201d beyond the type of speech that states can prohibit minors from accessing\u2014potentially encompassing things like depictions and discussions of human anatomy, sexuality, and reproduction. This follows a notable pattern: As we\u2019ve explained previously , lawmakers, prosecutors, and activists in conservative states have worked for years to aggressively expand the definition of \u201charmful to minors\u201d to censor a broad swath of content: diverse educational materials , sex education resources , art, and even award-winning literature .

In those days at Granny\u2019s, sitting with my cheese and the grown-ups in our rural mountain town, I might as well have been tasting Camembert on the banks of the Seine. Nevermind, too, the Mason jars of homemade soup on her shelves, a kaleidoscope of summer\u2019s bounty \u2014 tomatoes, okra, corn \u2014 put up and waiting to take the chill off colder days. Nevermind the freshly baked pound cakes under Tupperware domes like trophies, which she kept atop the washing machine, also in the kitchen, or the biscuits she could whip up with nary a measuring device or recipe.

Here is the portion of Hightouch\u2019s architecture dedicated to our events system: Hightouch events system architecture Our system scales on three levers: Kubernetes clusters that contain event collectors and batch workers, Kafka for event processing, and Postgres as our virtual queue metadata store. When our pagers went off during the AWS outage on the 20th, we observed: Services were unable to connect to Kafka brokers managed by AWS MSK. Services struggled to autoscale because we couldn\u2019t provision new EC2 nodes. Customer functions for realtime data transformation were unavailable due to AWS STS errors, which caused our retry queues to balloon in size. Kafka\u2019s durability meant that no events were dropped once they were accepted by the collectors, but there was a massive backlog to process. Syncs with consistently high traffic or with enrichments that needed to call slower 3rd party services took longer to catch up and were testing the limits of our (small) Postgres instance\u2019s ability to act as a queue for the batch metadata. As an aside, at Hightouch, we start \n\n[Content truncated...]",

Sunspot region 4274 produced its strongest solar flare thus far since it appeared on the east limb and the sixth strongest solar flare of the current solar cycle. An impressive long duration and highly eruptive X5.1 (R3-strong) solar flare peaked this morning at 10:04 UTC.\nIt became quickly clear that the eruption would be followed by an impressive coronal mass ejection (CME). The resulting coronal wave following the solar explosion as well as the coronal dimming observed as the CME was propelled into space were of a spectacular magnitude as can be seen in the animation below provided by\nhalocme\n.\nAnother eruption from AR12474, associated with an X5.1 flare.

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that this plasma cloud of course has an earth-directed component and it is pretty clear that this will be a strong impact when it arrives at our planet. This rightfully so prompted the NOAA SWPC to issue a G4 or greater geomagnetic storm watch for tomorrow as the cloud could impact our planet as early as 16 UTC on 12 November. Not only is the CME fast but it will also travel trough an area with high ambient solar wind speed and low density thanks to two other CMEs released earlier by this region.

What started as an experiment has grown into a project we are committing to, with apps already running on new platforms. It is time to show you what we have been building.\nTry It Right Now\nBefore we dive into the details, you can experience it yourself:\nLaunch MAUI in your browser \u00e2\u0086\u0092\nThis is a real MAUI application running on WebAssembly, rendered through Avalonia, with no plugins or hidden tricks. It is an early build with rough edges, but it proves the point: MAUI can now run on every major desktop OS and in the browser.\nWhat is the Avalonia MAUI Backend?\nAt its core, the Avalonia MAUI Backend enables you to keep your MAUI codebase while replacing the rendering layer with Avalonia. The goal is straightforward: take your existing MAUI applications and extend them to additional platforms, while enhancing desktop performance along the way.\nIn practical terms, that means several big wins.\nDesktop Linux support\n.NET MAUI apps running as first class desktop apps on distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora, sharing the same Avalonia renderer that already powers demanding desktop apps in production today.\nEmbedded Linux\nAvalonia already runs on embedded Linux devices, from Raspberry Pi panels to industrial HMIs. Using the same backend, the Avalonia MAUI Backend brings those capabilities to MAUI as well, so the applications you build in MAUI can run on the same embedded Linux targets as Avalonia.\nWebAssembly support\nThe demo you can open in your browser today is a real MAUI application running on WebAssembly, rendered by Avalonia, with no native dependencies on the client. It is an early build, but it demonstrates what is now possible. MAUI apps will soon be free to deploy to the browser.\nBonus: The Avalonia MAUI Backend runs on Windows\n\n[Content truncated...]"

Here are four of the odder spots.\nFour strange places to see London's Roman Wall\n1) From platform 1 at Tower Hill station\nIf you're ever waiting for a westbound train at Tower Hill station, take a walk to the rear of the platform and take a look across the tracks, roughly where the penultimate carriage would stop. High on the far wall is a square recess lined by black tiles, and at the back of that is a dimly-lit surface of chunky irregular blocks. Unlike every single other thing on the Underground, the Romans built that.\nLondon's original wall was 2 miles long, 6 metres high and almost 3 metres thick at its base, all the better to keep out uncivilised marauders. It was built around 200 AD, then left to decay and rebuilt in the medieval era, again for defensive purposes. This is one of the original bits, not that you can easily tell by squinting across the tracks. A small metal lamp points inwards but is no longer switched on because heritage illumination is not a TfL priority. There is however a rather nice silver plaque on the pillar opposite, should you step back far enough to notice it.\nThe plaque confirms that the stones here are a continuation of the wall seen (much more clearly) outside. What it doesn't mention is the unavoidable truth that the wall must once have continued across the tracks and platforms but is no longer here. That's because when the Circle line was constructed in 1882 the railway companies had permission to demolish 22 metres of London's wall and duly did, the Victorians never being afraid to destroy ancient heritage.\nIan Visits\nhas a photo of navvies standing atop the offending stonework just before they bashed it through.

      "content": "My Fan Worked Fine, So I Gave it WiFi\n3 November 2025\nI designed a fully revertible modification for a Vornado 633DC fan so I could control it remotely over WiFi. The final result is concealed entirely within the fan\u2019s housing, leaving no visible modification.\nIf you\u2019re interested in building one yourself, the schematic,\nBoM\n, and\nPCB\ndesign are all available\nhere\n. In terms of firmware, I used\nESPHome\nwith an external component, for which the source code is available\nhere\n. The rest of this post covers the research and development that went into the project.\nThe underside of the modified fan, boasting a larger, more advanced PCB than the original.\nHow it began\nWhen I first bought this fan I chose it because it uses a DC motor which, compared to AC counterparts, use less power, and run quieter. By adding a smart plug between it and a power outlet, I could give it a basic form of on/off remote control. But this presented a problem: If I wanted to adjust the speed I would have to physically interact with the fan!\nObviously, I needed to see what could be done about this, and so I took a look at the inside of the fan. Six screws later, and I was greeted with a surprisingly spacious interior.\nInside were two components:\nAn AC-DC converter\nA small PCB which held the potentiometer used for the speed control dial\nEverything joined up via a 2-pin and 5-pin connector on the PCB. From there, it was a straightforward matter of measuring voltages and continuity to work out what connected to what: the 2-pin connector was offering 24V DC. The 5-pin connector was what went off to the motor itself. Two of its pins were passing through the 24V DC and ground directly. Two more pins were connected to the potentiometer. The fifth pin was not connected.\nWith this, I concluded that the variable resistance between the two potentiometer pins is used to control the speed of the motor. From here the idea started to form: if I could produce a variable resistance digitally, I could control it r\n\n[Content truncated...]"

Working on market-leading apps such as Camera+,\nPhoton\nand\nREC\n, we\u2019ve always had our finger on the pulse on what users want out of their mobile photography.\nWith the ground-breaking release of OpenAI\u2019s\ngpt-image-1\nimage generation model earlier this year, we started investigating all the interesting use cases we could think of for AI image editing.\nBut as a company that has never taken any venture capital investment, all our products have to pay for themselves. We\u2019re in it to delight our users, not just capture market share and sell them out. When considering AI projects, one thing has been clear \u2013 we can\u2019t take the AI startup road where you have a generous free tier, charge an unreasonably small monthly fee for \u201cunlimited\u201d, and hope you\u2019re going to make it up on scale (code for \u201csomeone please acquire us\u201d).\nAll the AI-focused billing systems we could find out there were based on this. Assuming you want to claim unlimited access, and then sandbag users with \u201cfair use\u201d clauses and prevent them from any actual unlimited usage (which is, obviously, untenable, since you\u2019ll end up with one $20/mo user reselling to everyone else).\nSince we want to fairly charge our customers for what they actually use, we\u2019ve built a credit-based \u201cpay per generation\u201d-style billing system (that internally we\u2019ve been calling CreditProxy).
