The tl;dr is that it\u2019s a delightful laptop, and Linux runs flawlessly, and all the hardware things I\u2019ve needed run OOTB. The only difficulty I had was in disabling Secure Boot, but I figured out how to do it, which I explain below. Contents Background Troubleshooting Secure Boot Spyware Non-Problems BIOS Notes Links Background From early 2024 my daily driver was an M2 MacBook Air, until earlier this year I broke the screen, and the repair was quoted at almost 1000 AUD. Since I used it as a desktop most of the time, this didn\u2019t affect me much. After some flip-flopping I decided to get an M4 Mac mini. Partly for the faster CPU and more RAM, but partly because I liked the idea of LARPing like it\u2019s the 2000s, when computers, and by extension the Internet, where fixed in physical space, rather than following everyone around. Of course this was a terrible idea. I had three working computers\u2014a Linux+Windows desktop, a Mac Mini, and a MacBook Air that I could use as a desktop\u2014and none of them were portable. When I went to RustForge 2025 I just brought my phone. If I wanted to travel, even within Sydney, to a demo night or math club or some such, I didn\u2019t have a laptop to bring with me. So I needed a new laptop. And the Tahoe release of macOS was so ugly (see e.g. 1 , 2 , 3 ) it made me boot up the old Linux desktop, and start playing around with NixOS again. And I fell in love with Linux again: with the tinkering and the experimentation and the freedom it affords you. So, I wanted a Linux laptop. I had a ThinkPad X1 some years ago and it was terribly: flimsy plastic build and hardware that vastly underperformed its price. I looked around for old, refursbished workstation laptops, and, randomly, I ran into an eBay seller offering a refurbished Fujitsu laptop. The specs/price ratio was pretty good: 16 GiB of RAM and 512GiB of SSD, all for 250 AUD. And it was 12in and 1.1kg, which I like: laptops shou\n\n[Content truncated...]",

      "content": "Messing with bots 13 Nov, 2025 As outlined in my previous two posts : scrapers are, inadvertently, DDoSing public websites. I've received a number of emails from people running small web services and blogs seeking advice on how to protect themselves. This post isn't about that. This post is about fighting back. When I published my last post, there was an interesting write-up doing the rounds about a guy who set up a Markov chain babbler to feed the scrapers endless streams of generated data. The idea here is that these crawlers are voracious, and if given a constant supply of junk data, they will continue consuming it forever, while (hopefully) not abusing your actual web server. This is a pretty neat idea, so I dove down the rabbit hole and learnt about Markov chains, and even picked up Rust in the process. I ended up building my own babbler that could be trained on any text data, and would generate realistic looking content based on that data. Now, the AI scrapers are actually not the worst of the bots. The real enemy, at least to me, are the bots that scrape with malicious intent. I get hundreds of thousands of requests for things like .env , .aws , and all the different .php paths that could potentially signal a misconfigured Wordpress instance. These people are the real baddies. Generally I just block these requests with a 403 response. But since they want .php files, why don't I give them what they want? I trained my Markov chain on a few hundred .php files, and set it to generate. The responses certainly look like php at a glance, but on closer inspection they're obviously fake. I set it up to run on an isolated project of mine, while incrementally increasing the size of the generated php files from 2kb to 10mb just to test the waters. Here's a sample 1kb output: ' . $errmsg_generic .

Or perhaps you are taking a class and are being forced to create a programming language under penalty of a bad grade. What kinds of things do you need to know? Designing a Language Of course you want to design (and implement!) your own programming language! It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s creative. It\u2019s empowering. How do we do it? In a nutshell, the process is iterative, cycling between four phases: Doing the phases over and over is important; for example, while writing the compiler, you may be like \u201cwoah this is impossible\u201d and then realize \u201coh shoot this part of the language wasn\u2019t designed right!\u201d Prerequisites It helps to be experienced. If you\u2019re not, that\u2019s okay, actually\u2014you might get lucky! But don\u2019t mistake creativity for luck that shows up without pre-existing knowledge. The most creative people are those with a lot of knowledge and experience. So you should still study and practice! Your success as a language designer will be massively aided by knowledge in three main areas: Programming Paradigms . You should know a number of different ways that computations can be structured. These include: imperative declarative structured object-oriented functional applicative concatenative logic protocol-oriented aspect-oriented array event-driven dataflow agent-based etc. See Wikipedia\u2019s list of programming paradigms . Programming Language Concepts . You should have a good sense of most, if not all, of the following things: Sequencing, conditional execution, iteration, recursion, functional decomposition, modularity, synchronization, metaprogramming, binding, scope, extent, volatility, subtyping, pattern matching, type inference, closures, prototypes, introspection, instrumentation, annotations, decorators, memoization, traits, streams, monads, actors, mailboxes, comprehensions, continuations, wildcards, promises, regular expressions, proxies, transactional memory, inheritance, polymorphism, parameter modes,\n\n[Content truncated...]",

It's unfortunately no longer enough to force websites to check your government-issued ID before you can access certain content, because politicians have now discovered that people are using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to protect their privacy and bypass these invasive laws. Their solution? Entirely ban the use of VPNs. Yes, really. As of this writing, Wisconsin lawmakers are escalating their war on privacy by targeting VPNs in the name of \u201cprotecting children\u201d in A.B. 105 / S.B. 130 . It\u2019s an age verification bill that requires all websites distributing material that could conceivably be deemed \u201csexual content\u201d to both implement an age verification system and also to block the access of users connected via VPN. The bill seeks to broadly expand the definition of materials that are \u201charmful to minors\u201d beyond the type of speech that states can prohibit minors from accessing\u2014potentially encompassing things like depictions and discussions of human anatomy, sexuality, and reproduction. This follows a notable pattern: As we\u2019ve explained previously , lawmakers, prosecutors, and activists in conservative states have worked for years to aggressively expand the definition of \u201charmful to minors\u201d to censor a broad swath of content: diverse educational materials , sex education resources , art, and even award-winning literature . Wisconsin\u2019s bill has already passed the State Assembly and is now moving through the Senate. If it becomes law, Wisconsin could become the first state where using a VPN to access certain content is banned. Michigan lawmakers have proposed similar legislation that did not move through its legislature, but among other things, would force internet providers to actively monitor and block VPN connections. And in the UK, officials are calling VPNs \"a loophole that needs closing.\" This is actually happenin\n\n[Content truncated...]",

We released Go 1.24 in February and Go 1.25 in August , following our now well-established and dependable release cadence. Continuing our mission to build the most productive language platform for building production systems, these releases included new APIs for building robust and reliable software, significant advances in Go\u2019s track record for building secure software, and some serious under-the-hood improvements. Meanwhile, no one can ignore the seismic shifts in our industry brought by generative AI. The Go team is applying its thoughtful and uncompromising mindset to the problems and opportunities of this dynamic space, working to bring Go\u2019s production-ready approach to building robust AI integrations, products, agents, and infrastructure. Core language and library improvements First released in Go 1.24 as an experiment and then graduated in Go 1.25, the new testing/synctest package significantly simplifies writing tests for concurrent, asynchronous code . Such code is particularly common in network services, and is traditionally very hard to test well. The synctest package works by virtualizing time itself. It takes tests that used to be slow, flaky, or both, and makes them easy to rewrite into reliable and nearly instantaneous tests, often with just a couple extra lines of code. It\u2019s also a great example of Go\u2019s integrated approach to software development: behind an almost trivial API, the synctest package hides a deep integration with the Go runtime and other parts of the standard library. This isn\u2019t the only boost the testing package got over the past year. The new testing.B.Loop API is both easier to use than the original testing.B.N API and addresses many of the traditional\u2014and often invisible!\u2014 pitfalls of writing Go benchmarks. The testing package also has new APIs that make it easy\n\n[Content truncated...]",
