#### Naming Conventions
```
Before              →  After
run_graphql_query   →  execute_graphql_query
run_gh_command      →  execute_github_cli
get_suggested_actors →  fetch_assignable_actors
get_custom_agents   →  discover_custom_agents
get_issue_details   →  fetch_issue_details
```

#### Documentation Standards
- Module-level docstrings with features and examples
