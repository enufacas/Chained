# GitHub Copilot Custom Agents

This directory contains custom agent definitions following the [GitHub Copilot custom agents convention](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/custom-agents-configuration).

## What are Custom Agents?

Custom agents are specialized AI assistants that can be invoked in GitHub Copilot to help with specific tasks. Each agent has:

- **Specialization**: A focused area of expertise
- **Custom Instructions**: Tailored behavior and approach
- **Tools**: Access to specific tools and capabilities
- **Performance Tracking**: Evaluation based on contributions

## Agent Definitions

Each agent is defined in a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: "What this agent does"
tools:
  - tool1
  - tool2
---

# Agent Instructions

Custom instructions for the agent...
```

### Required Properties

- **name**: Unique identifier for the agent (kebab-case)
- **description**: Clear description of the agent's purpose and capabilities

### Optional Properties

- **tools**: List of tools the agent has access to

## MCP Servers

All agents have access to trusted, widely-adopted MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers:

- **GitHub MCP Server** (Microsoft/GitHub) - Repository management, code search, security scanning, web search
- **Playwright MCP Server** (Microsoft) - Browser automation, E2E testing, UI interaction

For detailed information about configured MCP servers, see **[MCP_SERVERS_CONFIGURATION.md](../../MCP_SERVERS_CONFIGURATION.md)** in the repository root.

## Using Custom Agents

Custom agents can be invoked:

1. **In GitHub Copilot Chat**: Use the agent name in your prompt
2. **In Issues**: Agents are automatically assigned based on specialization
3. **Via Workflow**: The agent spawner workflow creates tasks for agents

## Agent Performance

All agents are evaluated on:

- **Code Quality** (30%): Clean, maintainable code
- **Issue Resolution** (25%): Successfully completed tasks
- **PR Success** (25%): PRs merged without breaking changes
- **Peer Review** (20%): Quality of reviews provided

Agents must maintain a score above 30% to continue contributing, and can achieve Hall of Fame status with scores above 85%.
