## 🎯 How to Use Custom Agents

### Priority Rule
**ALWAYS delegate to custom agents first** when their expertise matches the task. Only handle tasks yourself when:
- No custom agent specializes in the domain
- The task is extremely simple (single line changes)
- You've tried delegating but the agent indicated it's not appropriate

### Agent Mention Rule ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT
**MANDATORY: When a custom agent is assigned to an issue, you MUST mention that agent by name using @agent-name syntax in EVERY conversation, comment, PR, and interaction related to that issue.**

**This is not optional. This rule is enforced through multiple mechanisms:**
1. Path-specific instruction files in `.github/instructions/` that apply to workflows, issues, and PRs
2. Automated workflow validation that checks for proper @mentions
3. Performance tracking that requires @mentions for attribution
4. Repository-wide conventions documented throughout the codebase

**Why This is Critical:**
- **Attribution**: Work MUST be properly credited to the specific agent
- **Performance Tracking**: Agent metrics rely on @mentions for attribution
- **Transparency**: The autonomous system requires clear agent identification
- **Accountability**: Each agent's contributions must be traceable
- **Collaboration**: Agents must be explicitly referenced in multi-agent scenarios
- **System Integrity**: Missing @mentions break the autonomous agent ecosystem

**Format Requirements:**
- Use `@agent-name` syntax (e.g., `@engineer-master`)
- Bold important mentions: `**@agent-name**`
- Include in ALL contexts: issues, PRs, comments, commits, code, documentation
- Repeat agent name in action lists and step-by-step instructions
- Add reminder text: "IMPORTANT: Always mention **@agent-name** by name"

**When Executing in GitHub Actions Runner:**
- When Copilot runs as a task in the GitHub Actions runner, the issue body will contain the assigned agent name
- **YOU MUST read the issue body** to identify which agent was assigned (look for `@agent-name` mentions)
- **YOU MUST use that specific agent** throughout your work by mentioning `@agent-name` in all outputs
- The agent mentioned in the issue is NOT just a suggestion - it is a **MANDATORY assignment**
- Treat the @agent-name as the identity you are working under for this task
- All PRs, comments, commits, and work must reference the assigned `@agent-name`

**Example Runner Scenario:**
```
Issue body contains: "**@engineer-master** - Please implement this API endpoint"

When you execute in the runner:
✅ DO: Mention "@engineer-master will implement..." in all communications
✅ DO: Reference "@engineer-master" in PR title and description  
✅ DO: Use "@engineer-master is working on..." in progress updates
❌ DON'T: Ignore the agent assignment
❌ DON'T: Use generic "I will implement..." without the agent name
```

**Examples:**

✅ **CORRECT:**
- "@engineer-master is implementing the API changes as specified in the issue."
- "**@engineer-master** will create the API endpoint following the engineer-master specialization."
- "I'm working with @troubleshoot-expert to debug this workflow failure."
- "This PR was created by **@create-guru** for infrastructure setup."
- "Great work, @secure-specialist, on fixing this vulnerability!"

❌ **INCORRECT:**
- "The engineer agent is implementing the API changes." (missing @mention)
- "This has been assigned to a custom agent." (not specific enough)
- "An agent will handle this task." (no agent identification)
- "Using the engineer-master profile." (missing @)
- "The agent fixed the bug." (which agent?)

## 🗺️ Context Awareness System

**@investigate-champion** has implemented a context awareness system to help agents access relevant historical insights when working on tasks.

### Available Context Files

When starting work, agents should check for `.context.md` files in the directory they're working in:

- **`.github/workflows/.context.md`** - Workflow development patterns, branch protection rules, agent attribution
- **`.github/agents/.context.md`** - Agent system behavior, coordination patterns, performance insights
- **`tools/.context.md`** - Tool development best practices and common patterns
- **`.github/instructions/.context.md`** - Guidance for creating effective path-specific instructions

### Context Index

The **`.github/context-index.json`** file provides a quick reference to all available context:
- Summaries of each context area
- Quick reference for common rules
- Links to data sources (knowledge graph, discussions, analysis)

### How to Use Context

1. **Before starting work:** Check if a `.context.md` file exists in your working directory
2. **Review key insights:** Understand patterns and decisions from similar past work
3. **Avoid known pitfalls:** Learn from common mistakes documented in context
4. **Reference discussions:** Link to specific issues when relevant context applies
5. **Apply learned patterns:** Use successful approaches from historical work

### Context Generation

Context files are auto-generated from:
- `learnings/discussions/knowledge_graph.json` - 75+ insights with 133 connections
- `learnings/discussions/*.json` - Detailed issue discussions and decisions
- `analysis/*.json` - Code archaeology and pattern analysis

**Regeneration:** Run `python tools/generate-context-summaries.py --update-all` to refresh context files

### Benefits of Context Awareness

- **Avoid repetition:** Don't reinvent solutions to problems already solved
- **Learn from mistakes:** Understand what didn't work in the past
- **Apply patterns:** Use successful approaches from similar tasks
- **Maintain consistency:** Follow established conventions and decisions
- **Better decisions:** Informed by historical context and experience

### Context vs. Context Window

**Important:** Context files are curated summaries (< 500 words each) designed to provide useful information without overwhelming the LLM context window. They're not comprehensive histories but targeted insights for better decision-making.

For deep dives, consult the full data sources in `learnings/` and `analysis/` directories.

### Agent Documentation Responsibilities

Every agent, including **@support-master**, MUST:

1. **Read Before Working**: Consult relevant documentation sources of truth before starting any task
2. **Document Changes**: Update documentation immediately after making architectural changes
3. **Validate Accuracy**: Verify documentation matches actual implementation
4. **Link Related Docs**: Cross-reference related documentation sections
5. **Report Gaps**: Create issues for missing or outdated documentation

### Documentation Update Process

When making changes that affect sources of truth:

```markdown
1. Make code/system changes
2. Update relevant documentation source(s) of truth
3. Add "Updated [DOCUMENT_NAME]" to PR description
4. Reference specific sections updated
5. Ensure documentation reflects new reality
6. Update last_updated date in document
```

### Example Documentation Update in PR

```markdown
## Changes Made
- Added new learning source for Stack Overflow trends
- Created `learn-from-stackoverflow.yml` workflow
- Added `/learnings/stackoverflow_*.json` storage

## Documentation Updates
✅ Updated `docs/DATA_STORAGE_LIFECYCLE.md`:
  - Section 1.1: Added `/learnings/` StackOverflow format
  - Section 2.1: Added StackOverflow Learning Workflow
  - Section 3.1.1: Added to Agent Decision Making sources
  - Updated last_updated date to 2025-11-17
```

### Validation Rules

**@support-master** and all agents must validate:
- ✅ All new storage locations documented in DATA_STORAGE_LIFECYCLE.md
- ✅ All new workflows documented with data flows
- ✅ All architectural changes reflected in AUTONOMOUS_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md
- ✅ All agent specialization changes updated in agent documentation
- ✅ Cross-references between documents are accurate
- ✅ Examples and diagrams reflect current implementation

### Autonomous Learning Integration

The autonomous learning pipeline creates a continuous feedback loop:

```
Learn → Analyze → Generate Ideas → Create Missions → Agents Work → 
Self-Document → Feed Back to Learning
```

**Every agent** participates in this loop by:
- **Learning from external sources**: TLDR, Hacker News, GitHub Trending
- **Learning from self**: Analyzing completed work, PR discussions, issue resolutions
- **Documenting insights**: Creating learnings that feed back into the system
- **Maintaining knowledge**: Keeping documentation sources accurate and current

### Documentation Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **DON'T**:
- Make architectural changes without updating docs
- Create new storage locations without documenting them
- Add workflows without documenting data flows
- Leave documentation outdated for more than 48 hours
- Assume someone else will update the docs

✅ **DO**:
- Update docs as part of the same PR as code changes
- Reference documentation in commit messages
- Validate documentation accuracy before completing tasks
- Cross-link related documentation sections
- Keep documentation synchronized with reality

---

**Remember**: Custom agents are your first choice for specialized work. They are domain experts designed to deliver high-quality solutions in their areas of expertise. Use them liberally and trust their specialized capabilities.

**Documentation is Living**: The autonomous system evolves continuously. Documentation must evolve with it. **@support-master** champions this principle.
