# CODEOWNERS file for Chained repository
#
# This file defines who must review and approve changes before they can be merged.
# It ensures the repository owner maintains control over external contributions
# while still allowing autonomous Copilot/AI workflows.

# Repository owner must review all changes by default
# This prevents outside contributions from being merged without review
* @enufacas

# Note: The auto-review-merge workflow will only auto-merge PRs that are:
# 1. Created by the repository owner (@enufacas) with the 'copilot' label, OR
# 2. Created by trusted bots (github-actions[bot], dependabot[bot], copilot) with the 'copilot' label
#
# All other PRs will require manual review and approval from @enufacas
