          # Learning Database

          This directory contains learnings collected from external sources.

          ## Sources

          - **TLDR Tech**: Tech news summaries (twice daily)
          - **Hacker News**: Trending discussions (3x daily)

          ## Format

          Learning files are stored as JSON with the following structure:
          - `timestamp`: When the learning was captured
          - `source`: Where it came from (tldr, hackernews)
          - `topics`: Categorized topics
          - `insights`: Key takeaways
          - `trends`: Identified trends

          ## Usage

          These learnings influence the Smart Idea Generator to create
          trend-aware ideas based on what's happening in the tech world.
