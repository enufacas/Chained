              This PR was not automatically merged because it does not meet the criteria for autonomous merge.
              
              **Auto-merge criteria:**
              - PR must be from the repository owner (\`${repo_owner}\`) AND have the \`copilot\` label, OR
              - PR must be from a trusted bot (\`github-actions[bot]\`, \`app/github-actions\`, \`dependabot[bot]\`, \`app/dependabot\`, \`copilot*[bot]\`) AND have the \`copilot\` label
              
              **Current PR details:**
              - Author: \`${author}\`
              - Has copilot label: $([ "${has_copilot_label}" -gt 0 ] && echo "✅ Yes" || echo "❌ No")
              - From repository owner: $([ "${is_repo_owner}" -eq 1 ] && echo "✅ Yes" || echo "❌ No")
              - From trusted bot: $([ "${is_trusted_bot}" -eq 1 ] && echo "✅ Yes" || echo "❌ No")
              
              **Next steps:**
              The repository owner will need to manually review and approve this PR before it can be merged.
