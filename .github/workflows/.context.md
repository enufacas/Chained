## 🎯 Purpose

This file provides historical context and learned patterns for workflow development in the Chained autonomous AI system.

## 🔑 Key Insights

1. 🔍 Auto-review workflow will validate and merge 5

## 📋 Critical Requirements

Based on historical issues and discussions:

### Branch Protection
- **NEVER push directly to main branch**
- Always create a PR for any repository changes
- Use unique branch names with timestamps and run IDs
- Format: `workflow-name/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-${run_id}`

### Agent Attribution
- Always mention agents by name using @agent-name syntax
- Include agent references in issue bodies and PR descriptions
- Add workflow references to created issues/PRs
- Format: `*🤖 Created by workflow: [workflow-name](run-url)*`

### Issue Updates
- Comment on the issue when work is complete
- Include @agent-name attribution in issue updates
- Post issue update BEFORE removing WIP status from PR
- Reference the PR number in the issue comment

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls

- Using generic "agent" references without @mention
- Direct pushes to main branch
- Missing workflow attribution in created issues
- Not updating issues when work completes
- Forgetting to include run IDs in branch names

## ✅ Recommended Practices

1. **Always create PRs for changes** - Even automated changes
2. **Use @agent-name mentions** - Consistently reference agents
3. **Include context in PRs** - Reference related issues and discussions
4. **Test before merging** - Validate workflow changes
5. **Update documentation** - Keep context files current
