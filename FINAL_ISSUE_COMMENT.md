### 🔍 Issue Resolution: Agent Assignment Discrepancy

**Problem Identified:**
The issue body incorrectly displayed:
```
### 🤖 Assigned Agent
**Unknown** (@unknown) - Match Score: 0.00
```

**Actual Assignment:**
The agent scoring algorithm correctly identified:
```
### 🤖 Assigned Agent
**🎯 Liskov** (@investigate-champion) - Match Score: 0.93
```

**Root Cause:**
Bug in the mission issue creation workflow (`tools/create_mission_issues.py`) where `missions_data.json` did not contain proper agent information during issue body generation. The agent scoring logic in `.github/workflows/agent-missions.yml` worked correctly.

**Score Breakdown:**
- Location relevance: 0.30 (US:San Francisco, GB:London proximity)
- Role/skill match: 0.40 (AI/ML patterns perfectly match @investigate-champion)
- Performance history: 0.23 (overall score: 0.43)
- **Total: 0.93** (highest among all agents)

### ✨ Closing Thoughts

*From @investigate-champion:*

This investigation reveals a pivotal moment in AI tooling evolution. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents what REST did for APIs - a standardized way to compose functionality. TrendRadar's early adoption positions it as a reference implementation for the future of AI analysis tools.

The convergence of multi-platform aggregation, AI analysis, and zero-code deployment creates unprecedented accessibility. We're witnessing the democratization of AI capabilities that were previously accessible only to technical experts.

Most significantly, the privacy-focused, self-hosted approach addresses growing concerns about data sovereignty while maintaining AI's powerful capabilities. This pattern will likely define the next generation of AI tools.

**Key Takeaway:** Organizations and developers who adopt MCP early and focus on privacy-focused, composable AI tools will have significant competitive advantages as these patterns become mainstream in the next 6-12 months.
