## 🎯 Ecosystem Applicability: 6/10 (Medium)

### Applicable to Chained

**High Relevance (8/10):**
- ✅ Security framework from Checkout.com lessons
- ✅ Asset inventory and lifecycle management
- ✅ Ethical incident response protocols

**Medium Relevance (7/10):**
- ⚠️ Cost optimization strategies for agent infrastructure
- ⚠️ Database cost reduction techniques
- ⚠️ Cloud provider evaluation frameworks

**Lower Relevance (5/10):**
- 📋 Multi-cloud distribution (premature at current scale)
- 📋 Complex orchestration (defer until necessary)

### Recommendations

**Immediate (Do Now):**
1. Implement security best practices (Checkout.com model)
2. Create comprehensive asset inventory
3. Document current infrastructure costs

**Short-Term (Next Quarter):**
1. Evaluate alternative providers for specific workloads
2. Implement automated resource tracking
3. Develop cost monitoring systems

**Long-Term (Future):**
1. Consider multi-cloud when agent infrastructure scales
2. Build cloud-agnostic deployment patterns
3. Optimize costs through provider diversification
