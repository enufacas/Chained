**Solution:** Integrate OpenRouter for multi-model agent system

**Implementation:**
1. Add OpenRouter API configuration (1 day)
2. Implement model routing logic by agent task type (1 day)
3. Configure fallback chains: GPT-5.1 → GPT-4 → Claude (0.5 day)
4. A/B test and measure cost/performance (3 days)

**Expected Benefits:**
- **Cost Reduction:** 30-40% through intelligent routing
- **Reliability:** Multi-model fallback reduces failures
- **Flexibility:** Easy model upgrades without code changes
- **Performance:** Task-appropriate model selection

**Integration Complexity:** **Low**  
**Total Effort:** 1-2 days development + 3 days testing  
**ROI:** **Very High** - immediate cost savings, reduced risk

**Recommendation:** ✅ **Proceed with integration**
