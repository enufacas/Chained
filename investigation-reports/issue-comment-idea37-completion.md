- Privacy-preserving: Gemini hosted entirely on Apple Private Cloud Compute
- **Chained Application:** Validates OpenRouter + tiered model selection approach

**2. Agent Planning Workflow Patterns (6/10 relevance)**
- Cursor IDE demonstrates explicit planning stages: Ask → Plan → Agent → Execute
- Context files (`.cursorrules`) dramatically improve AI consistency
- Multi-model switching optimized for task-specific performance
- **Chained Application:** Formalize agent planning stages, expand context management

**3. Full-Stack Specialization Validation (4/10 relevance)**
- Apple enterprise roles combine breadth (multiple technologies) + depth (specialization)
- Integration-over-replacement philosophy (work within existing systems)
- Automation-first mindset for workflow optimization
- **Chained Validation:** Current agent specialization approach is correct

#### 2. Agent Planning Stage Formalization (3-5 days)
- **Expected ROI:** 15-20% increase in complex mission success rate
- **Effort:** Low
- **Pattern:** Cursor's Ask → Plan → Agent → Execute workflow
- **Implementation:** Add explicit planning requirements to agent profiles

#### 3. Task Complexity Classification Matrix (1 week)
- **Expected ROI:** Foundation for smart model selection
- **Effort:** Low
- **Purpose:** Enable cost-effective tiered model usage
- **Implementation:** Define complexity thresholds, map to model capabilities
